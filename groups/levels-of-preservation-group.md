The Levels of Digital Preservation Working Group is managed by the Levels of Digital Preservation Steering Group. This Steering Group manages all activities related to the Levels of Digital Preservation created by the NDSA. The Steering Group was originally formed to guide and steer the work of the sub-groups that were created for [Levels reboot activities in 2018](/groups/levels-of-preservation/history/).

Once these activities were complete in 2019, the Steering Group continued to meet. Its purpose is to:

- Promote and encourage use of the NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation
- Respond to community feedback on the NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation
- Carry out further revisions and create supporting resources as appropriate
- Report to the NDSA Coordinating Committee on its activities

New members will be added to a larger Working Group once additional work is identified.
