The Levels of Digital Preservation Working Group is managed by the Levels of Digital Preservation Steering Group. This Steering Group manages all activities related to the Levels of Digital Preservation created by the NDSA. The Steering Group was originally formed to guide and steer the work of the sub-groups that were created for [Levels reboot activities in 2018](/groups/levels-of-preservation/history/).

Once these activities were complete in 2019, the Steering Group continued to meet. Its purpose is to:

- Promote and encourage use of the NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation
- Respond to community feedback on the NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation
- Carry out further revisions and create supporting resources as appropriate
- Report to the NDSA Coordinating Committee on its activities

New members will be added to a larger Working Group once additional work is identified.  

### Current Work
The Levels Steering group meets monthly to discuss the future needs around the Levels of Digital Preservation.  The group also holds quarterly open sessions to engage the community and to hear feedback on the Levels in preparation for updates to the exisitng Levels - anyone is welcome to attend these sessions.  The group continues to discuss the Levels with the community at conferences to solicit feedback and to better understand how the Levels are being used.  

As part of the [review cycle](https://ndsa.org/groups/schedule/), the Levels Working Group was re-formed in mid-2024 in order to carry out a targeted revision to the Levels on the topic of environmental sustainability. The focus of this work is a result of community feedback gathered by the Steering Group in 2023 and earlier.  The group is currently doing background work and will formally get started in September 2024.  Work is expected to continue throughout 2024 and into 2025.
