## Background
In [2011](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may13/altman/05altman.html), [2013](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july17/gallinger/07gallinger.html), and [2019](https://osf.io/uwsg7/) members of the NDSA Infrastructure Interest Group conducted surveys on the preservation storage practices of NDSA member organizations. The goal of these surveys was “to develop a snapshot of storage practices within the organizations of the NDSA and insight into how those practices change over time.”  The goal of the most recent Survey [2023](https://osf.io/9qp4w/) is to gather current information and insight on trends, technologies, standards, and practices that impact digital preservation storage and evaluate changes from previous surveys.  

## 2023 Storage Survey Report  
The [2023 Storage Survey Report](https://osf.io/9qp4w/) was published in October of 2024.  The report documents the answers provided by 138 responents from 14 countries.
