## Background
In [2011](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may13/altman/05altman.html), [2013](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july17/gallinger/07gallinger.html), and [2019](https://osf.io/uwsg7/) members of the NDSA Infrastructure Interest Group conducted surveys on the preservation storage practices of NDSA member organizations. The goal of these surveys was “to develop a snapshot of storage practices within the organizations of the NDSA and insight into how those practices change over time.” 


## 2023 Working Group Objectives 
The 2023 Storage Survey Working Group is currently setting up their first meetings.  Stay tuned for more information on their upcoming work.  <!--in late 2018 to gather new data on preservation storage practices. The goal of the 2019 survey was not only to collect updated information in order to compare to the [2011](https://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/19768) and [2013](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8NYC97) survey data, but to gather information on how new technologies or standards have impacted preservation storage. Work was completed in 2019 and the final report was published in Feburuary 2020.  -->
