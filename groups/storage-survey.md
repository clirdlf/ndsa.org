## Background
In [2011](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may13/altman/05altman.html), [2013](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july17/gallinger/07gallinger.html), and [2019](https://osf.io/uwsg7/) members of the NDSA Infrastructure Interest Group conducted surveys on the preservation storage practices of NDSA member organizations. The goal of these surveys was “to develop a snapshot of storage practices within the organizations of the NDSA and insight into how those practices change over time.”  The goal of the 2023 Survey is to gather current information and insight on trends, technologies, standards, and practices that impact digital preservation storage and evaluate changes from previous surveys.

## 2023 Working Group Objectives 
The 2023 Storage Survey Working Group will be releasing the 2023 Storage Survey in the fall of 2023, with the objective of producing a report on the survey findings by Summer of 2024.
