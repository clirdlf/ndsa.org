## Background
In [2011](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may13/altman/05altman.html) and in [2013](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july17/gallinger/07gallinger.html), members of the NDSA Infrastructure Interest Group conducted surveys on the preservation storage practices of NDSA member organizations. The goal of these surveys was “to develop a snapshot of storage practices within the organizations of the NDSA and insight into how those practices change over time.” 

## Overview and Description
The 2019 Storage Survey Working Group was convened in late 2018 to gather new data on preservation storage practices. The goal of the 2019 survey is not only to collect updated information in order to compare to the [2011](https://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/19768) and [2013](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8NYC97) surveys, but to gather information on how new technologies or standards have impacted preservation storage.
