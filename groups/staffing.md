Initiated within the [Standards and Practices Interest Group](http://ndsa.org/working-groups/standards-and-practices/) the Staffing Survey Working Group was established in November 2016 as a collaboration of interested NDSA members.  

The Staffing Survey Working Group is working to re-release a survey about staffing practices as a follow up to the NDSA 2012 Staffing Survey.  As was the case after the 2012 survey, a report will be published with the results.  The goal is to better understand current staffing levels and staffing needs around the area of digital preservation.  This work will also provide a set of data to compare with the 2012 survey results.
