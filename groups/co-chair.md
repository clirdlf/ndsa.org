The following is provided as a resource for interested members to know how to become a co-chair of an Interest or Working group and understand the responsibilities of being a co-chair.  

### What are my responsibilities?
Co-chairs lead monthly calls around topics of interest to NDSA members and the digital curation community, contribute to the strategic planning for NDSA, participate in Leadership calls, update the group webpage, maintain group documentation, and may lead or collaborate on Working Group projects. Co-chairs are also expected to help create an annual roadmap of what the group hopes to accomplish during a given calendar year. It’s a great way to collaborate and contribute to the digital preservation and stewardship community.

### How do I put myself forward?
Contact one of the existing co-chairs of an Interest Group you’re interested in, and let them know! Co-chairs often let their Interest group know when a chair is rolling off (typically at year end after DigiPres), so those involved already can step up if desired. If this doesn’t happen within the existing group, often a larger call to the NDSA-All listserv may be put forth. NDSA does not typically hold elections for co-chair positions unless necessary.

### How long is the appointment?
Generally, most co-chairs serve for two years, though some have served for more. Ideally, co-chair terms are staggered when possible so replacement for both chairs doesn’t happen in the same year. However, NDSA keeps the co-chair appointment time length flexible (read: no hard term limits or commitments) to allow for both leadership change and longevity of co-chair leadership as desired by community and Interest Group members.

### What is the time commitment?

- **Approximately 1 hour a month co-leading Interest Group calls**: Often co-chairs trade responsibility for leading Interest Group calls, which can consist of leading a topic-based discussion or hosting a presenter on a topic 
  
- **Approximately a half hour to an hour a month (average) group administrative duties**: Including planning for calls, contacting speakers, coordinating presentations, welcoming new members to the group, and writing reminder emails to the group about calls

- **Approximately 1 hour a month on NDSA Leadership calls**: Leadership calls consists of the Coordinating Committee, Interest Group co-chairs, a member from our host organization, CLIR/DLF, and any current Working Group chairs. 

- **In-person meeting at Digital Preservation conference**: For the last several years, Leadership has a meeting sometime during the Digital Preservation conference to allow for in-person strategic planning and review. Attendance is highly encouraged, but not mandatory.
