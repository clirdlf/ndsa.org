Geospatial Data Stewardship: Key Online Resources

All links current as of 03/01/14

This list of geospatial data stewardship resources is a companion to the NDSA report published in February of 2014 and will be updated on a regular basis to provide the most current information available.

This document lists online resources that highlight key concepts and practices supporting the preservation and stewardship of digital geospatial data and information. GIS practitioners take the initial preservation actions in the decisions they make regarding data creation and management. Librarians, archivists and museum professionals are often called on to support access and the long-term historical and temporal analysis of these same materials. The resources below offer a starting point to methods, tools and approaches across the information lifecycle to assist in understanding current best practices in the stewardship of geospatial data.

A comprehensive list of resources can be found at Geospatial Data Preservation, a site hosted and maintained by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University: http://geopreservation.org.

## Introductions to Geospatial Data Stewardship

## Geospatial Stewardship Business Planning

Resources on the business and legal issues that must be addressed to secure sustainable support for geospatial stewardship activities.

## Geospatial Data Appraisal and selection

Resources that address the processes of appraisal and selection as they apply to geospatial data with long-term value. Appraisal is often associated with government archival and records management processes and concerns the identification of records or other information to determine the merits of long-term or permanent retention.  Selection is typically associated with libraries and addresses the identification of materials for preservation because of their continuing value.
