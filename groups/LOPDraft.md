The Levels of Preservation Working Group was re-formed in 2018 with the main purpose of updating the Levels of Preservation Matrix. The **full set activities of the 2018 group are provided on the [history](/groups/levels-of-preservation/history/) page** for the LOP Working Group.

The Levels of Preservation Working Group is ongoing and manages activities related to the Levels of Preservation created by the NDSA.  Subgroups are formed as needed to address the needs of the community. 

Due to the complexity of the activities of the Levels of Preservation Working Group, the group is managed by a Steering Group.  The Steering Group is comprised of past and current sub-group leads.  

### Current Work
After the completion of Version 2.0 of the Levels of Preservation, other supporting materials are being created.  In addition to the supporting materials, the Steering Group is working with the NDSA Coordinating Committee to address future updates to the Levels.
