**Infrastructure Interest Group Co-Chairs**: Leah Prescott - lp627 [at] georgetown [dot] edu and Eric Lopatin - Eric [dot] Lopatin [at] ucop [dot] edu

The Infrastructure Interest Group works to identify and share emerging practices around the development and maintenance of tools and systems for the curation, preservation, storage, hosting, migration, and similar activities supporting the long term preservation of digital content. Cloud storage and computing platforms are given special focus given their trends.
