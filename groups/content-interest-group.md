**Content Interest Group Co-Chairs:** Brenda Burk - bburk [at] clemson [dot] edu; Deb Verhoff - deb [dot] verhoff [at] nyu [dot] edu


The Content Interest Group will intentionally engage the priorities and important resources promoted by the NDSA and the broader profession, and explore a broad array of topics related to preserving digital content, including: viable approaches to institutional collaboration; sharing strategies to address issues of scale and complexity; and the development of policies, practices, and community action to promote ethical and sustainable labor for digital stewardship.

*Take me to the [Content Interest Group Listserv](http://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A0=NDSA-CONTENT)! If you are already a member of this Interest Group, you can always access the listserv (including its archives) at that link. To join this Interest Group, please contact the coordinators.*

## Meetings
  * The Content Interest Group meets the first Wednesday of each month at 1pm EST.
    * Calendar invites are not sent out due to the changing nature of the membership list.  We encourage you to create a recurring invite to your own calendar, using the information found in the meeting agenda/notes document linked below.
  * Call in information is available on the running [meeting agenda/notes document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/120yQwnmLQYEYRTmNVU9qkkxBM1SS_21G84P5i89Ycp0/edit#). 


## Activities
The Content Interest Group has spun up the Web Archiving Survey Working Group multiple times over the years in an effort to establish a longitudinal review of web archiving practices.  The results of and reports produced from this work can be found on the [Web Archiving Survey](https://osf.io/4ytb2/) Project page in OSF, including reports from 2011, 2013, 2016, and 2017.

The Content Interest Group is focusing on investigating guidelines for the selection of significant content, discovery of at-risk digital content or collections, and engaging all stakeholders in the process of acquiring the content, preserve it, and provide access to it. The Content Interest Group's current scope of work involves "content teams" grouped in the following topical areas:

- Government
- Geospatial
- News, Media, and Journalism
- Science, Mathematics, Technology and Medicine
- Social Sciences Cultural Heritage Arts & Humanities

The Content Teams are assessing and selecting categories of content in their topical areas that are important for preserving. The groups are developing case studies and/or models to share broadly with all stakeholders, from content producers to cultural heritage organizations. The goal of the case studies is to engage all members of the community in the preservation of content and to encourage the cultivation of relationships that could enable preservation.

Case Studies will:

- Establish the value of the content and provide the rationale for selecting it for preservation. What value does the content have? Is anyone collecting it? What factors affect its risk of disappearance?
- Document recognized opportunities for preserving this content. Are there workflows in the creation or distribution of content that present opportunities for preservation?
- Describe target audiences/stakeholders. Who would find value in this content and how might they be engaged in the process of preservation?
- Outline a plan for educating stakeholders. How might NDSA or another organization raise the awareness of stakeholders including content creators, publishers, educators, libraries, researchers, or donors?
- Describe potential obstacles or risk factors. What barriers for users/creators/preservationists might be faced and what options are there for overcoming them?
- Develop actionable next steps. What can we do next, as a community or as individual institutions to ensure that important content is preserved?

Additionally, Content Interest Group Members have been engaged in:

- A blog preservation plugin to easily enable content creators to opt-in to preservation.
- Bi-annual surveying of organizations in the United States who are actively involved in or planning to archive content from the web.  

### Web Archiving Survey
During Winter 2016, the Web Archiving Survey Working Group invited U.S. organizations engaged in web archiving or in the process of planning a web archive to take the NDSA Web Archiving Survey. The [report](/documents/WebArchivingintheUnitedStates_A2016Survey.pdf) (PDF, 761 KB) was published in Spring 2017. A list of the survey questions is available [here](/documents/2016NDSAWebArchivingSurvey_SurveyMonkey.pdf) (PDF, 136 KB).

A report of the 2013 survey results is available [here](/documents/NDSA_USWebArchivingSurvey_2013.pdf) (PDF, 1010 KB) along with the [2013 survey questions](/documents/ndsa_web_archiving_survey_2013.pdf) (PDF, 196 KB).

A report of the 2011 survey results is available  [here](/documents/ndsa_web_archiving_survey_report_2012.pdf) (PDF, 442 KB) along with the [2011 survey questions](/documents/USWebArchivingSurvey.pdf) (PDF, 272 KB).

### Recently Published Report: "Geospatial Data Stewardship: Key Online Resources"
 A [report](/documents/NDSA_AppraisalSelection_report_final102413.pdf) (PDF, 550 KB) of the Geospatial Content Team that lists online resources highlighting key concepts and practices supporting the preservation and stewardship of digital geospatial data and information. The resources offer a starting point to methods, tools and approaches across the information lifecycle to assist in understanding current best practices in the stewardship of geospatial data. These resources will be regularly updated online at the "[Geospatial Data Stewardship: Key Online Resources](/working-groups/content/geospatial-data-stewardship/)" web page.

### Recently Published Report: "Issues in the Appraisal and Selection of Geospatial Data"

A [report](/documents/NDSA_AppraisalSelection_report_final102413.pdf) (PDF, 554 KB) of the Geospatial Content Team considering both appraisal and selection activities as they effect decisions defining geospatial content of enduring value to the nation.-->
