The Fixity Working Group was established May 31, 2016 as a joint collaboration of the [Standards & Practices Interest Group](http://ndsa.org/working-groups/standards-and-practices/) and the [Infrastructure Interest Group](http://ndsa.org/working-groups/infrastructure/) in order to move forward with reccomendations from the [Fixity Guidance Report](http://ndsa.org/documents/NDSA-Fixity-Guidance-Report-final100214.pdf) and the [NDSA National Agenda](http://ndsa.org/national-agenda/). The Fixity Working Group created the Fixity Survey as a way to address the "... clear need for use-case driven examples of best practices for fixity in particular system designs and configurations established to meet particular preservation requirements" raised in the 2015 NDSA National Agenda.  The survey set a baseline for activities being done in 2016.  Future work will build off of these initial results. 

## Get Involved

This working group will be spinning back up in the Spring of 2021.  If you are interested in participating please contact Carol Kussmann at kussmann [@] umn.edu.    

The group was interested in producing case studies on fixity practices at various institutions. Please contact NDSA at ndsa.digipres [@] gmail.com if interested in contributing.  You could also fill out this [interest survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGgHnPesMzJoZWQ0bmfXpOjnsONNeYCKTPC0gy2VBgdwYvCA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## 2016-2017 Activities

- The Fixity Working Group met at *Digital Preservation 2016* to foster "a [next-level conversation](http://dlfforum2016.sched.org/event/8LHa/lunchtime-working-session-fixity-a-deep-dive-into-the-bits) on optimization, parameters, routines, resources & algorithms". Notes from the conversation are [available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vue4k39jJzW53yZHgYIVSn4bRbh7i1ngIWlyxzNe4pQ/edit?usp=sharing).
- A subgroup of people looked into vendor fixity requirements and produced [Vendor Fixity: An Attempt at Definition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rw0lKmorHIE_KLLf6aiKurKCBpEhHJR5ofQsztjwHvw/edit?usp=sharing) a report of their findings for the NDSA Leadership.  The goal was to determine if there was a simpler method by which potential users could do a cross comaprison of how various servies defined fixity.  
- The [2017 Fixity Survey Report](https://osf.io/snjbv/) was produced by the group documenting fixity practices across the community. The code book and data is also available on the same OSF site.
