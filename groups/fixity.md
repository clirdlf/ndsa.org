The Fixity Working Group was originally established May 31, 2016 as a joint collaboration of the [Standards & Practices Interest Group](http://ndsa.org/working-groups/standards-and-practices/) and the [Infrastructure Interest Group](http://ndsa.org/working-groups/infrastructure/) in order to move forward with reccomendations from the [Fixity Guidance Report](http://ndsa.org/documents/NDSA-Fixity-Guidance-Report-final100214.pdf) and the [NDSA National Agenda](http://ndsa.org/national-agenda/). The Fixity Working Group created the Fixity Survey as a way to address the "... clear need for use-case driven examples of best practices for fixity in particular system designs and configurations established to meet particular preservation requirements" raised in the 2015 NDSA National Agenda.  The survey set a baseline for activities being done in 2016.  Future work will build off of these initial results and work towards developing longitudinal studies.   

The Fixity Working Group started up for the second time in April of 2021 and completed work in October 2021. The report and associated documents can be found on the [2021 Fixity Survey](https://osf.io/2qkea/) OSF site.

## Contact Us
While the most recent survey work is complete, if you have any questions or are interested in working on the next iteration of this survey in a few years, please contact the Fixity Working Group at NDSA-Fixity [@] lists [dot] clir [dot] org.  

## 2021 Products and Activities
- The [2021 Fixity Survey Report](https://osf.io/2qkea/) documents the results of the 2021 survey and compares these with the 2017 results when applicable.  In addition, the 2021 Report includes case studies documenting how fixity is used with each organization building on the findings of the survey itself.  
- Case studies documenting how various instutions handle fixity are included in the report.  
- The survey data and a crosswalk between the 2017 and 2021 survey questions is also on the [NDSA OSF](https://osf.io/2qkea/) page.


## 2021 Scope of Work

## 2016-2017 Products and Activities

- The Fixity Working Group met at *Digital Preservation 2016* to foster "a [next-level conversation](http://dlfforum2016.sched.org/event/8LHa/lunchtime-working-session-fixity-a-deep-dive-into-the-bits) on optimization, parameters, routines, resources & algorithms". Notes from the conversation are [available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vue4k39jJzW53yZHgYIVSn4bRbh7i1ngIWlyxzNe4pQ/edit?usp=sharing).
- A subgroup of people looked into vendor fixity requirements and produced [Vendor Fixity: An Attempt at Definition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rw0lKmorHIE_KLLf6aiKurKCBpEhHJR5ofQsztjwHvw/edit?usp=sharing) a report of their findings for the NDSA Leadership.  The goal was to determine if there was a simpler method by which potential users could do a cross comaprison of how various servies defined fixity.  
- The [2017 Fixity Survey Report](https://osf.io/snjbv/) was produced by the group documenting fixity practices across the community. The code book and data is also available on the same OSF site.
