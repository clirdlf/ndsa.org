**Standards and Practices Interest Group Co-Chairs**: Felicity Dykas, University of Missouri Libraries - dykasf [at] missouri [dot] edu; **Open Position** (contact Felicity if interested)

The Standards and Practices Interest Group works to facilitate a broad understanding of the role and benefit of standards in digital preservation and how to use them effectively to ensure durable and usable collections.

In addition, the Interest Group seeks to identify, promote and widely disseminate practices found to be effective for selecting, organizing, describing, managing, preserving and serving digital content, in collaboration with other individuals and organizations where appropriate.

Smaller working groups frequently emerge from the Standards and Practices Interest Group.

  * The meetings are held the second Monday of the months listed below at 1pm EST:
    * January 10th
    * April 11th
    * July 11th
    * October 10th
  * Calendar invites are not sent out due to the changing nature of the membership list.  We encourage you to create a recurring invite to your own calendar, using the information found in the meeting agenda/notes document linked below.
  * Call in information is available on the running [meeting agenda/notes document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13mvPbJ3bNUDMyvuQHac0YryiRPEnwHQY7Tk_x_e3n4c/edit).

### Report: "The Benefits and Risks of the PDF/A-3 File Format for Archival Institutions"

A [report](/documents/NDSA_PDF_A3_report_final022014.pdf) (pdf) created by the Standards and Practices Interest Group that takes a measured look at the costs and benefits of the widespread use of the PDF/A-3 format, especially as it effects content arriving in collecting institutions. It provides background on the technical development of the specification, identifies specific scenarios under which the format might be used and suggests policy prescriptions for collecting institutions to consider. More information in a [2/20/14 blog post](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2014/02/new-ndsa-report-the-benefits-and-risks-of-the-pdfa-3-file-format-for-archival-institutions/) on the Signal.

### Report: "Staffing for Effective Digital Preservation"

A [report](/documents/NDSA-Staffing-Survey-Report-Final122013.pdf) (pdf) created by the Standards and Practices Interest Group, sharing what the group learned by surveying 85 institutions with a mandate to preserve digital content about how they staffed and organized their preservation functions.
