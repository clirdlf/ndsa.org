The Standards and Practices Interest Group works to facilitate a broad understanding of the role and benefit of standards in digital preservation and how to use them effectively to ensure durable and usable collections.

In addition, the Interest Group seeks to identify, promote and widely disseminate practices found to be effective for selecting, organizing, describing, managing, preserving and serving digital content, in collaboration with other individuals and organizations where appropriate.

Smaller working groups frequently emerge from the Standards and Practices Interest Group. Current activities include:

- Conducting a survey to identify biggest challenges related to preserving video and creating action plans to address the survey results
- Initiating an Email Preservation Interest Group to discuss issues, projects and workflows to preserve email
- Hosting a Digital/Software-Based Art discussion with leading experts in the field
- Continuing a project to improve Wikipedia’s [coverage of digital preservation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Digital_Preservation) in general, but particularly in these areas:
  - Digital preservation terms, concepts, theories, strategies and history
  - Standards, best practices and common methods for:
    - Packaging, transferring or modeling digital content
    - Preserving the usability of digital content long-term
    - Encoding and wrapping digital content using file formats, compression schemes, etc.
    - Describing digital content using metadata
  - Preservation repository architecture, operations and policies
  - Certifying the trustworthiness of preservation repositories
  - Related large-scale initiatives

### Report: "The Benefits and Risks of the PDF/A-3 File Format for Archival Institutions"

A [report](/documents/NDSA_PDF_A3_report_final022014.pdf) (pdf) created by the Standards and Practices Interest Group that takes a measured look at the costs and benefits of the widespread use of the PDF/A-3 format, especially as it effects content arriving in collecting institutions. It provides background on the technical development of the specification, identifies specific scenarios under which the format might be used and suggests policy prescriptions for collecting institutions to consider.
