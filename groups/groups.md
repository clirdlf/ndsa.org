<p>The NDSA has established <strong>Interest Groups</strong> focusing on broad areas of digital preservation, out of which smaller <strong>Working Groups</strong> often emerge. All NDSA member organizations commit to providing participants for one or more groups. Questions about which group you should join? Chat with the Interest Group chairs, or send an email to <a href="mailto:ndsa.digipres@gmail.com">ndsa.digipres@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Getting Involved</h3>
<p>Anyone from an NDSA member organization is welcome to join one or more groups.  Opportunities are also available to help lead Interest Group and Working group activities.  For more information on the responsibilities and expectations of a co-chair review the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="/groups/co-chairing/">Co-Chairing an NDSA Group</a> page.</p>  
<h3>Group Formation</h3>
<p>NDSA participants may form Interest Groups (IGs) and Working Groups (WGs) at will, in order to discuss mutual interests, and advance joint projects. <a style="font-weight:bold" href="/groups/formation/">Details</a> on the process for forming a new group, group requirements and expectations are provided by the NDSA Leadership team.</p>

<!--<p>This process is self-organizing and light-weight. NDSA requires only that groups must be documented publicly, be open to participation, be transparent in discussion and outputs, have a designated Facilitator, and garner the involvement of at least three individual participants from different NDSA organizations. Interest Groups will remain the gateway for new members into NDSA activities. WGs and IGs are encouraged and authorized to share news, events, calls for comments, and draft outputs (with appropriate NDSA branding and WG attribution) through the NDSA mailing lists and social media channels. Details on group requirements and formation process can Please contact the NDSA Leadership team if you would like to form a new group:<a href="mailto:ndsa.digipres@gmail.com">ndsa.digipres@gmail.com</a>

<h3>Interest Groups</h3>

<h4><a href="/groups/content/">Content</a></h4>
<ul><li><p>Focusing on the selection, discovery and preservation of digital content. For example, the group members are conducting surveys around US web archiving practices and developing case studies around a variety of types of content to share compelling stories
    that demonstrate the value of digital preservation in our communities.
</p></li></ul>

<h4><a href="/groups/standards-and-practices/">Standards and Practices</a></h4>
<ul><li><p>Promoting effective methods for digital content selection, organization, preservation and access. Current activities include work to enhance coverage information and resources on born digital preservation concerns and criteria in Wikipedia.</p></li></ul>

<h4><a href="/groups/infrastructure/">Infrastructure</a></h4>
<ul><li><p>Working to identify and share emerging practices around the development and maintenance of tools and systems for curation and preservation. For example, the Infrastructure Interest Group is studying and reporting on member approaches to design and operation
    of large scale storage systems.</p></li></ul>

<h3>Working Groups</h3>
<p>Working Groups are created on an as needed basis.  Once formed, groups may perform a one-time activity, a cyclical activity, or an ongoing activity.  This activity level is listed after the Working Group name below.  Further details about each group is provided on their individual pages.</p>

<h4><a href="/groups/communications-publications/">Communications and Publications (ongoing)</a></h4>

<h4><a href="/groups/fixity/">Fixity (cyclical)</a></h4>
<ul><li><p>Created to address the “… clear need for use-case driven examples of best practices for fixity in particular system designs and configurations established to meet particular preservation requirements” raised in the 2015 NDSA National Agenda. This group produced the 2017 Fixity Survey Report as a result of their work. A 2021 survey is in progress.</p></li></ul>

<h4><a href="/groups/innovation-awards/">Innovation Awards (annually)</a></h4>

<h3>Former Interest Groups</h3>
<p>These Interest Groups were retired by NDSA Leadership and are no longer active.  Their pages are provided as reference to past activities.</p>

<h4><a href="/groups/innovation/">Innovation</a></h4>
<p>
    <strong>The Innovation Interest Group is no longer active.</strong> Activities of this working group were suspended in 2016. The Innovation Interest Group has a more than six-year history of activity under the umbrella of NDSA. Its focus involved
    encouraging and sharing innovative methods of digital preservation practices and technologies. For example, the innovation group highlighted innovative projects and practitioners through a series of published interviews. The group also developed and
    ran an awards program to recognize groundbreaking work in digital stewardship, which is now administered by the <a href="http://ndsa.org/awards/">Awards Working Group</a>.
</p>

<h4><a href="/groups/outreach/">Outreach</a></h4>
<p>
    <strong>The Outreach Interest Group is no longer active.</strong> Activities of this working group were suspended in 2014. Its focus was on building relationships with stakeholder communities and preparing and sharing digital preservation information
    resources. The group worked to support the release of the 2014 National Agenda for Digital Stewardship, published the Digital Preservation in a Box outreach toolkit, supported regional NDSA meetings, and developed tools to make it easier for partners
    to share information about their work. The work done by this Interest Group is being done by other Working Groups and the NDSA Leadership Team. Please contact the <a href="http://ndsa.org/leadership/">Leadership Team</a> with ideas and suggestions.</p>
