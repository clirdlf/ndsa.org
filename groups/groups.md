The NDSA has established **Interest Groups** focusing on broad areas of digital preservation, out of which smaller **Working Groups** often emerge. All NDSA member organizations commit to providing participants for one or more groups and may use the [Working Group Schedule](/groups/schedule/) to plan for their participation. Questions about which group you should join? Chat with the Interest Group chairs, or send an email to [ndsa.digipres@gmail.com](mailto:ndsa.digipres@gmail.com).

### Getting Involved
Anyone from an NDSA member organization is welcome to join one or more groups.  Opportunities are also available to help lead Interest Group and Working group activities.  For more information on the responsibilities and expectations of a co-chair review [Co-Chairing an NDSA Group](/groups/co-chairing/) including additional documentation for chairing a survey working group.

#### Join NDSA Slack

### Group Formation
NDSA participants may form Interest Groups (IGs) and Working Groups (WGs) at will, in order to discuss mutual interests, and advance joint projects. [Details on the process for forming a new group](/groups/formation/), group requirements and expectations are provided by the NDSA Leadership team.
### Interest Groups
There is one Interest Group meeting a month, with the three groups working on a rotating schedule. The schedule for each of the Interest Groups is provided on their webpages. Due to the changing nature of the group membership lists, calendar invites are not sent out. We encourage you to create a recurring invite to your own calendar, using the information found in the meeting agenda/notes document for the group you are interested in.
#### [Content](/groups/content/)
- Focusing on the selection, discovery and preservation of digital content. For example, the group members are conducting surveys around US web archiving practices and developing case studies around a variety of types of content to share compelling stories that demonstrate the value of digital preservation in our communities.

#### [Standards and Practices](/groups/standards-and-practices/)
- Promoting effective methods for digital content selection, organization, preservation and access. Current activities include work to enhance coverage information and resources on born digital preservation concerns and criteria in Wikipedia.

#### [Infrastructure](/groups/infrastructure/)
- Working to identify and share emerging practices around the development and maintenance of tools and systems for curation and preservation. For example, the Infrastructure Interest Group is studying and reporting on member approaches to design and operation of large scale storage systems.

### Working Groups
Working Groups are created on an as needed basis.  Once formed, groups may perform a one-time activity, a cyclical activity, or an ongoing activity.  This activity level is listed after the Working Group name below.  Further details about each group is provided on their individual pages.

#### [Communications and Publications](/groups/communications-publications/) (ongoing)
- Working with the Coordinating Committee and Group Chairs to assist with internal and external communications, blog posts, website updates, and editing and publishing NDSA reports and other materials.

Awards are given out at DigiPres conferences occurring in odd-numbered years.
  
#### [Fixity](/groups/fixity/) (cyclical)
- Created to address the “...clear need for use-case driven examples of best practices for fixity in particular system designs and configurations established to meet particular preservation requirements” raised in the 2015 NDSA National Agenda. This group produced the 2017 Fixity Survey Report as a result of their work. A 2021 survey is in progress.

#### [Levels of Preservation](/groups/levels-of-preservation/) (ongoing)

#### [Storage Survey](/groups/storage-survey/) (cyclical)
