The Web Archiving Working Group was originally established October 2011 by the [Content Interest Group](content-interest-group.md). The Web Archiving Survey produced reports in 2011, 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2023.  All reports can be found on the [NDSA OSF](https://osf.io/4ytb2/) page.

## 2022 Scope of Work and Products
The Web Archiving Survey Working Group conducted a survey of organizations, in the United States and internationally, actively involved in, or interested in starting, programs to archive content from the Web. The survey builds on the previous four iterations of the ‘Web Archiving in the United States’ surveys. 

The Working Group acknowledged that there had been substantial changes in the field in the five years since the last NDSA Web Archiving Survey. These developments included but were not limited to: Archive-It gaining 250+ new partners; refined and upgraded tools including Archive-It’s Brozzler, Webrecorder’s ArchiveWeb.page, and Documenting the Now’s DocNow app; articles on web archiving published in mainstream publications like The Atlantic, The Columbia Journalism Review, MSNBC, NPR, and Nature; initiatives like Project Stand, Archiving the Black Web, and Ethics and Archiving the Web; and last but not least, the COVID-19 pandemic, which left librarians, archivists, and historians wondering how to best document new realities which were often or solely available online. 

The 2022 Web Archiving Survey was based off of previous surveys to provide long-term analysis while also allowing further reflections upon changes in the field.  Accounting for the growth of the web archiving field and its impact, the 2022 Working Group developed a survey guided by the following questions:
 
- Why archive the web? 
- What do cultural heritage workers collect through web archiving tools? 
- What infrastructure do practitioners need to support web archiving efforts?
- What does web archiving look like at different types of institutions in the United States and abroad? 

The group produced the [2022 Web Archiving Survey Report](https://osf.io/n5myr/).

<!--It has been five years since the last published survey, allowing for substantial changes in the field, and to current and future web archiving practices. Since 2017:

- Archive-It has added 250 new partners;
- Widely utilized tools have been refined and upgraded:
  - Archive-It (1) launched Brozzler, a browser-based collecting tool in 2020;
  - Webrecorder.io became Conifer;
  - Webrecorder unveiled an improved version of OldWeb.today and introduced ArchiveWeb.page;

- Efforts like [Project Stand](https://rhizome.org/editorial/2020/jun/11/introducing-conifer/), [Archiving the Black Web](https://archivingtheblackweb.org/), and [Ethics and Archiving the Web](https://eaw.rhizome.org/) have launched and convened, encouraging conversations about web archiving across varying disciplines and institutions;

(1) ‘Web Archiving in the United States: a 2017 Survey’ notes that: ‘Archive-It has been the favored external service provider since the National Digital Stewardship Alliance began [conducting these surveys] in 2011, when 75% of responding institutions were using it. Use of Archive-It has increased as more institutions embark upon Web archiving; in 2013, 71% of institutions reported use, and in 2016, 87% of institutions reported use’ [(https://osf.io/ht6ay/, 20)](https://osf.io/ht6ay/). In 2017, 94% of institutions reported use. Changes to Archive-It impact the entire field of Web archiving.-->
