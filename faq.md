## Membership

**Should our organization join the NDSA?**

If your organization has an active digital preservation program and wants to work with other experts in the field, yes, your organization should join the NDSA. Consortia, non profits, commercial entities and international organizations are all welcome to apply for membership or join as an Affiliate. At this time, individuals are not eligible to join the NDSA. Please see the [membership packet](/documents/MembershipPacket201103.pdf) (PDF, 94 KB) for more information about the values and principles of the NDSA.

**How can my organization check the status of our application?**

Email ndsa@loc.gov

**What commitment is expected if my organization joins the NDSA?**

It is expected that members actively engage in digital stewardship and share their lessons learned and practical knowledge about ensuring long term access to digital materials. Working Groups are the primary mechanism through which the NDSA accomplishes its [goals](/). Participation in working group conference calls and projects can take anywhere from two to seven hours a month. There are no fees associated with joining the NDSA.

**What are the benefits of joining the NDSA?**

Members have a direct contact with experts in digital stewardship and an opportunity to affect national digital stewardship strategy and initiatives. Participation in NDSA Working Group products provides practical benefit to local programs and shared results. All NDSA members receive access to listservs, wikis and other shared resources.

## Participation

**Which working groups are right for my organization?**

The answer is going to depend on what exactly your organizations goals and needs are. It is generally best to try and match the right people in your organization with the right working group. For example, developers, and IT staff and administrators are a great fit for the [Infrastructure working group](/workgroups/infrastructure/), where individuals in marketing and communications are a great fit for the [Outreach working group](/working-groups/outreach/). It is best to think about what your organizations strengths are and work from there. In general, the more directly the working groups mission fits with the nature of the individuals participating from member organizations the more that both the NDSA and the working group benefit.

**How do we join a specific working group?**

When organizations join the NDSA the individuals they identify which working groups they would like to join and identify which individuals they want to participate in those groups. Once a organization joins those individuals are added to the working group listservs and given access to the NDSA wiki. Individuals at member organizations can also join other groups at any point. To join a particular working group contact ndsa@loc.gov, mention what member organization you represent and make your request.

**Can individuals switch to a different working group?**

Yes, individuals associated with member organizations can change working groups at any point. We realize that as the work evolves, members may find themselves in the "wrong" group. Contact a Working Group Co-Chair if you have questions about switching working groups.

**Can member organizations participate in more than one working group?**

Yes, the NDSA encourages participation on multiple working groups. In most cases, it is best to have different individuals from a member organization participate in different working groups. Ideally, the work of the working group will be a direct and natural fit for the nature of the group they participate in.

**Does the NDSA providing funding?**

The NDSA does not provide funding for projects (some member organizations do though) or build tools and infrastructure (some member organizations do though).
