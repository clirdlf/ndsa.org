## Membership

### Should my organization join the NDSA?

If your organization has an active digital preservation program and wants to work with other experts in the field, then yes, your organization should join the NDSA. Consortia, non profits, commercial entities and international organizations are all welcome to [apply for membership](/get-involved/) or join as an Affiliate. At this time, individuals are not eligible to join the NDSA. Please see the [membership packet](/documents/MembershipPacket201103.pdf) for more information about our values and principles.

### How can my organization check the status of our application?

Our [Coordinating Committee](/coordinating-committee/) evaluates membership applications on a monthly basis. If it has been more than a month since you completed your application, please feel free to check in: <mailto:ndsa@diglib.org>

### What commitment is expected if my organization joins the NDSA?

Members are expected to engage actively in digital stewardship and share lessons learned and practical knowledge about ensuring long-term access to digital materials. Working Groups are the primary mechanism through which the NDSA accomplishes its [goals](/). Participation in working group conference calls and projects can take anywhere from two to seven hours a month. There are no fees associated with joining the NDSA.

### What are the benefits of joining the NDSA?

Members have direct contact with experts in digital stewardship and an opportunity to affect national digital stewardship strategies and initiatives. Participation in NDSA Working Group activities provides practical benefit to local programs and shared results. All NDSA members receive access to our listservs and other shared resources.

### Does the NDSA provide funding?

The NDSA does not provide funding for projects or building tools and infrastructure, although some of our member organizations do. Look for [relevant funding opportunities](https://www.diglib.org/opportunities/) in data curation and digitization from NDSA's host organization, [CLIR](http://clir.org/)+[DLF](https://diglib.org/).

### How does NDSA relate to the DLF? To CLIR?

CLIR and the [Digital Library Federation](https://diglib.org/) believe strongly in NDSA's mission and [set of values](/values/). NDSA is financially supported by the DLF, which also provides communications infrastructure, staff time, and participation by the DLF director on NDSA's [Coordinating Committee](/coordinating-committee/). [CLIR](http://clir.org/) is the parent organization of the DLF, but DLF itself runs on independent membership fees. If you like what the Digital Library Federation is doing to support digital stewardship at no cost to NDSA members, please [join DLF](https://www.diglib.org/members/join/) and contribute!

## Participation

### Which working groups are right for my organization?

The answer depends on what exactly your organizational goals and needs are. It is generally best to try to match the right people in your organization with the right NDSA working group. For example, developers and IT staff and administrators are a great fit for the [Infrastructure working group](/working-groups/infrastructure/) and individuals in marketing or communications are a great fit for the [Outreach](/working-groups/outreach/). Think about what your organization's strengths are and work from there. In general, the more directly the working group's mission suits the individuals who participate from your organization, the more you, the NDSA, and the working group benefit.

### How do we join a specific working group?###

When organizations join the NDSA, they indicate which groups they would like to join, and which individuals will participate in each of those groups. Once a organization's application is approved, those people are added to the relevant listservs and can begin collaborating. Individuals at member organizations can also join other NDSA working groups at any point. To join a particular group, contact <ndsa@diglib.org>, let us know what member organization you represent, and make your request.

### Can I switch to a different working group?###

Yes, people associated with NDSA member organizations can change working groups at any point. Contact a [Working Group Co-Chair](/working-groups/) if you have questions about making a switch.

### Can member organizations participate in more than one working group?###

Definitely! We encourage participation on multiple working groups. In most cases, it is best to have different people from a member organization participate in different working groups. Ideally, the working group will be a direct and natural fit for the nature of each individual's role within your organization.

## Member Communication

### How do members access NDSA listservs?###
