Look here for more information on our new Fixity Working Group, coming soon! This group is exploring a possible update to NDSA's 2014 [Fixity Guidance Report](http://ndsa.org/documents/NDSA-Fixity-Guidance-Report-final100214.pdf) and fostering "a [next-level conversation]("https://dlfforum2016.sched.org/event/8LHa/lunchtime-working-session-fixity-a-deep-dive-into-the-bits") on optimization, parameters, routines, resources & algorithms" at *Digital Preservation 2016.*

Contact working group chair Aaron Collie of Michigan State University Libraries - collie at mail dot lib dot msu dot edu  - to get involved.
