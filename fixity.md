The Fixity Working Group was established May 31, 2016 as a joint collaboration of the [Standards & Practices Interest Group]("http://ndsa.org/working-groups/standards-and-practices/"") and the [Infrastructure Interest Group]("http://ndsa.org/working-groups/infrastructure/") in order to move forward with reccomendations from the [Fixity Guidance Report]("http://ndsa.org/documents/NDSA-Fixity-Guidance-Report-final100214.pdf") and the [NDSA National Agenda]("http://ndsa.org/national-agenda/"). The Fixity Working Group is currently working to address the "... clear need for use-case driven examples of best practices for fixity in particular system designs and configurations established to meet particular preservation requirements" raised in the 2015 NDSA National Agenda.
