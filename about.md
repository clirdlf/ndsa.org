The National Digital Stewardship Alliance is a [consortium of organizations](/members-list/) committed to the long-term preservation of digital information. The mission of the NDSA is to establish, maintain, and advance the capacity to preserve our nation's digital resources for the benefit of present and future generations.

NDSA was launched as a membership organization in July 2010 as an initiative of the National [Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/index.php) of the Library of Congress. For an inaugural 4-year term, NDIIPP provided secretariat and membership management support to the NDSA, contributing Interest Group leadership, expertise, and administrative support.

The NDSA's institutional home as of January 1, 2016, is the [Digital Library Federation (DLF)](https://www.diglib.org), at the [Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR)](http://www.clir.org/). Selection of DLF followed a nationwide search and evaluation of cultural heritage, membership, and technical service organizations, in consultation with NDSA Interest Groups, their members, and external advisors.

### Who We Are
The NDSA is a dynamic organization with more than 220 [member organizations](/members-list/), including universities, government and nonprofit organizations, commercial businesses, and professional associations. NDSA members have proven themselves in the field of digital stewardship.

Activities of the NDSA are organized by 3 [Interest Groups](/working-groups/), each with two co-chairs, and led by an elected [Coordinating Committee](/leadership/) with representation from the DLF.

While membership in the NDSA is at the institutional level, individuals serving in leadership roles are highly experienced in the areas of digital stewardship and have made contributions to the field of digital preservation. A partial list of these individuals and their contact information is available through the [NDSA Experts Guide](/experts-guide/).

### How We Work
NDSA members join by completing a [membership application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAtyX61Rmnp0uxB7daaqnKEVSbgip2C7nO92C9Ybzox7LpEw/viewform), agreeing to our Principles of Collaboration and Membership Agreement, found in the NDSA [Membership Packet](/documents/Member_Packet_2018.pdf), and by participating in [Interest and Working Groups](/working-groups/). There are no fees to join the NDSA but members do commit to work collaboratively and share expertise. An elected [Coordinating Committee](/leadership/) provides strategic direction for the NDSA.

### What We Do
The NDSA organizes a national network of collaborative partners to take stewardship action toward three primary objectives:

- **Identifying, communicating and advocating** for common needs of member organizations.
- **Convening and sustaining a national community** of practice for digital stewardship.
- **Providing professional development opportunities** for staff at member organizations.

We work toward those goals through three primary types of activities:

- **Reports and Guidance Materials**: Interest Groups produce a range of [reports and guidance materials](/activities-overview/); for example, the [Levels of Digital Preservation](/activities/levels-of-digital-preservation/), the NDSA Storage Survey, and the NDSA Staffing Survey each serve to identify and communicate common needs of member organizations. In 2013, the NDSA published the inaugural [National Agenda for Digital Stewardship](/national-agenda/), a guiding document that outlines the challenges and opportunities related to digital preservation activities. 
- **Meetings and Events**: Regional gatherings, meetups, and NDSA's annual *Digital Preservation* conference are particularly important as professional development opportunities and as a means to connect and network a national community of practice for digital stewardship. See the [NDSA Calendar](/calendar/) for a list of [NDSA meetings](/meetings/) and upcoming presentations at conferences.
- **Knowledge Exchange**:  Regular briefings, demos, and webinars on tools, techniques, and approaches to digital preservation serve as ongoing professional development opportunities for staff at member organizations, while disseminating information about the tools and services many NDSA member organizations are developing. For a calendar of upcoming events, including Interest Group calls and presentation dates, see the [NDSA Calendar](/calendar/).
