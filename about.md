The National Digital Stewardship Alliance is a consortium of organizations that are committed to the long-term preservation of digital information. The mission of the NDSA is to establish, maintain, and advance the capacity to preserve our nation's digital resources for the benefit of present and future generations.

The NDSA was launched as a membership organization in July 2010 as an initiative of the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program.

For an inaugural 4-year term, the Library of Congress has provided secretariat and membership management support to  the NDSA, contributing working group  leadership, expertise, and administrative support. The NDSA Coordinating Committee and The Library of Congress seek proposals from organizations to host the NDSA for its next 4-year term. More information about the NDSA transition can be found here.

## What We Do
The NDSA organizes a national network of collaborative partners to take stewardship action across a range of issues and functions toward three primary objectives:

- **Identifying, communicating and advocating** for common needs of member organizations.
- **Convening and sustaining a national community** of practice for digital stewardship.
- **Providing professional development opportunities** for staff at member organizations.

The NDSA works toward those goals through three primary types of activities.

- **Reports and Guidance Materials**: Working groups produce a range of reports and guidance materials, for example the Levels of Digital Preservation, the NDSA Storage Survey and the NDSA Staffing Survey each serve to identify and communicate common needs of member organizations. In 2013, the NDSA published the inaugural National Agenda for Digital Stewardship, a guiding document that outlines the challenges and opportunities related to digital preservation activities. A complete list of reports and other projects is available.
- **Meetings and Events**: Regional meetings, meetups, and through representation at the NDIIPP-hosted annual Digital Preservation meeting. are particularly important as professional development opportunities and as a means to connect and network a national community of practice for digital stewardship. See the NDSA Calendar for a list of upcoming presentations at conference and meetings.
- **Knowledge Exchange**:  Monthly or bi-monthly briefing, demo and presentation webinars on tools, techniques and approaches to digital preservation serve as ongoing professional development opportunities for staff at members while disseminating information about the tools and services many NDSA member organizations are developing.
- For a calendar of upcoming events, including working group calls, webinars and presentation dates, see the NDSA Calendar.

The work of the NDSA is organized by 5 working groups, each with two co-chairs, and led by an elected Coordinating Committee.
