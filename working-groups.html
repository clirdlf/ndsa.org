<p>The NDSA has established <strong>Interest Groups</strong> focusing on broad areas of digital preservation, out of which smaller <strong>Working Groups</strong> often emerge. All NDSA member organizations commit to providing participants for one or more groups. Questions about which group you should join? Chat with the Interest Group chairs listed below, or send an email to <a href="mailto:ndsa@diglib.org">ndsa@diglib.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Group Formation</h3>
<p>NDSA participants may form Interest Groups (IGs) and Working Groups (WGs) at will, in order to discuss mutual interests, and advance joint projects. </p>

<p>This process is self-organizing and light-weight. NDSA requires only that groups must be documented publicly, be open to participation, be transparent in discussion and outputs, have a designated Facilitator, and garner the involvement of at least three individual participants from different NDSA organizations. Interest Groups will remain the gateway for new members into NDSA activities. WGs and IGs are encouraged and authorized to share news, events, calls for comments, and draft outputs (with appropriate NDSA branding and WG attribution) through the NDSA mailing lists and social media channels. Please contact the NDSA Secretariat at the <a href="https://diglib.org">Digital Library Federation</a> if you would like to form a new group: <a href="mailto:ndsa@diglib.org">ndsa@diglib.org</a></p>
