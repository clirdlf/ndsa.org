The challenges of digital stewardship are greater than any single institution can address. Membership in the NDSA connects you to [partnering organizations](/members-list/) and individuals around the country working to address those challenges and devise community solutions.

The NDSA organizes a national network of collaborative partners to take stewardship action across a range of issues, including by:

- Setting a strategic, national agenda for digital stewardship;
- Identifying, selecting, and stewarding digital collections that should to be preserved and made available;
- Indicating and authoring appropriate digital stewardship standards;
- Encouraging the development and maintenance of tools for curation and preservation;
- Encouraging and conducting research in digital preservation sciences and technologies;
- Building relationships with stakeholder communities;
- Preparing and sharing digital preservation information resources.

**If you're not yet an NDSA member, we urge you to [get involved](/get-involved/)!** Our Coordinating Committee reviews applications from new members on a monthly basis.
