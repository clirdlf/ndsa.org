### About the NDSA and Digital Preservation 2018:

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance is a consortium of more than 220 organizations committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. Digital Preservation 2018 ([#digipres18](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digipres18&src=typd)) will help to chart future directions for both the NDSA and digital stewardship, and is expected to be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field.

The conference will be held at the beautiful [M Resort](http://www.themresort.com/), just outside of Las Vegas, NV. The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event, and will operate under the DLF Forum’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/code-of-conduct/).

### Keynote: Snowden Becker
[Snowden Becker](https://snowdenbecker.com/) will open Digital Preservation 2018 with a talk entitled “**To See Ourselves as Others See Us: On Archives, Visibility, and Value**.”

Becker manages the graduate degree program in audiovisual archiving and preservation in the [Department of Information Studies](https://is.gseis.ucla.edu/programs/graduate-degree-programs/mlis-specializations) at UCLA, where she also [teaches](https://snowdenbecker.com/courses-and-syllabi/) courses in preservation and archival administration. She previously worked at Academy Film Archive, J. Paul Getty Museum, and Japanese American National Museum. Becker is pursuing a PhD in Information Science at University of Texas at Austin. She has an MLIS from UCLA Graduate School of Education & Information Studies and a BFA from Maryland Institute, College of Art.

Snowden Becker’s research interests focus on how audiovisual materials are integrated into, accessed, and preserved as part of our larger cultural heritage. Her forthcoming dissertation, Keeping the Pieces: Evidence management and archival practice in law enforcement, addresses the property room as a type of archive, and examines how audiovisual recordings and file-based media are managed alongside material evidence in law enforcement organizations. That work has led into additional research projects related to the creation, management, and preservation of audiovisual evidence, including an [IMLS-funded National Forum](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/re-43-16-0053-16) on data management needs arising from large-scale video recording programs such as police body-worn cameras.

### Digital Preservation Mentorship Program
This year the Digital Preservation 2018 planning committee is piloting a NDSA mentorship program, based on the successful DLF Forum Mentors. This program is intended to be lightweight and seeks to establish mentoring relationships among our community members, centered around face-to-face interaction at #digipres18. 

As part of the Digital Preservation 2018 registration process, registrants will have the opportunity to sign up as either a mentor or mentee. The NDSA program committee will facilitate the matching, based on expertise and mentee requests. Mentors agree to:
- Exchange emails and/or set up a phone/video chat to get to know each other before the conference
- Meet up as early as possible at Digital Preservation 2018, to be a friendly face, help make introductions, and generally advise on how to make the most of the conference
- Offer career advice as requested, based on their own experience
- Maintain confidentiality and exhibit professionalism in all interactions (including by adhering to DLF’s Code of Conduct)

In addition, mentors will have access to a private discussion forum that can be used to get and give advice, explore mentorship philosophy, and provide feedback that will help shape the pilot program.
