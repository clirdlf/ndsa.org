### About the NDSA and Digital Preservation 2019:

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance is a consortium of more than 220 organizations committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. Digital Preservation 2019 ([#digipres19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/digipres19)) will help to chart future directions for both the NDSA and digital stewardship, and is expected to be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field.

The conference will be held at the beautiful [Tampa Marriott Waterside Hotel & Marina](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/tpamc-tampa-marriott-waterside-hotel-and-marina/) in Tampa, Florida, on October 16-17, 2019. The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event and will operate under the DLF Forum’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/code-of-conduct/).

Please bookmark this page for updates as work on ([#digipres19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/digipres19)) gets underway.
