### Call for Proposals: Digital Preservation 2018: In/visible Work

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) invites proposals for **Digital Preservation 2018: “In/visible Work”** to be held in Henderson, NV, October 17-18, 2018.

Digital Preservation is the major meeting and conference of the NDSA—open to members and non-members alike—focusing on tools, techniques, theories and methodologies for digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, the content lifecycle, and related issues. Our 2018 meeting is held in partnership with our host organization, the Digital Library Federation (DLF). Separate calls are being issued for **[Learn@DLF](https://forum2018.diglib.org/learndlf/)** (October 14) and **[2018 DLF Forum](https://forum2018.diglib.org/)** (October 15-17)—all happening in the same location.

**[Proposals are due by May 7 at 11:59pm Pacific Time.](https://www.conftool.pro/dlf2018/)** 

**About the NDSA and Digital Preservation 2018:**
The National Digital Stewardship Alliance is a consortium of more than 220 organizations committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. Digital Preservation 2018 ([#digipres18](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digipres18&src=typd)) will help to chart future directions for both the NDSA and digital stewardship, and is expected to be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field.

The conference will be held at the beautiful [M Resort](http://www.themresort.com/), just outside of Las Vegas, NV. The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event, and will operate under the DLF Forum’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/code-of-conduct/). 

**Submissions:**
250-word proposals describing the presentation/demo/poster are invited (500 words for full panel sessions). Please also include a 50-word short abstract for the program if your submission is selected. Submit proposals online: [https://conftool.pro/dlf2018/](https://conftool.pro/dlf2017/). 

**Deadline:** May 7th, 2018 at 11:59pm PT.

We especially encourage proposals that speak to our conference theme, **“In/visible Work.”** 

Digital preservation efforts are supported by deep and complex infrastructures of people, organizations, software, technology, and standards. When these components align, preservation and access of digital materials may appear to be an effortless and seamless process — however, much of the work to collect, acquire, build, maintain, describe, and preserve digital collections is hidden from primary stakeholders and end users alike. This year, DigiPres 2018 invites presentations and workshops around the theme of “In/visible Work,” which seek to highlight the many layers and labors of digital preservation. Along with other digital preservation topics, the program committee is particularly interested in presentations that address:
- Labor & workforce development;
- Underrepresented people, collections and communities;
- Maintenance and the work of digital maintainers;
- Tech-debt, “degralesence,” and retroactive labor;
- Financial sustainability, environmental resources, and social costs of technologies;
- Storage commitments, contracts and costs;
- Models and strategies for post-custodial digital preservation; or
- Transparency, openness, and identity.

Submissions are invited in the following lengths and formats:

- **Talks/Demos:** Presentations and demonstrations are allocated 30 minutes each. Speakers should reserve time for interactive exchanges on next steps, possible NDSA community action, and discussion or debate.
- **Panels:** Panel discussions with 4 or more speakers will be given a dedicated session. "Manels"/all-male panels will not be accepted into the conference and proposals involving a diversity of speakers will be looked on favorably by the committee
- **Minute Madness:** Share your ideas in 60 seconds or less as part of the opening plenary of the conference. Presenters will have the option to display posters during the reception that follows. (Guidelines for poster sizes will be provided on acceptance.)
- **Lunchtime Working Group Meetings:** NDSA working and interest group chairs are invited to propose group meetings or targeted collaboration sessions. (Lunch provided.)

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by NDSA’s volunteer Program Committee. Presenters will be notified in June and guaranteed a registration slot at the conference.
