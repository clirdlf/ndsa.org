*Digital Preservation* is the major meeting and conference of the NDSA, open to [NDSA members](http://ndsa.diglib.org/members-list/) and non-members alike, and focusing on digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, and related issues.

Our *[Digital Preservation 2016](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/ndsa-digipres16/)* conference will be the first organized in partnership with the [Digital Library Federation](https://diglib.org/). Mark your calendars for November 9-10, 2016, and we'll see you at the historic [Pfister Hotel](http://www.thepfisterhotel.com/) in Milwaukee, WI, just after the closing of the [2016 DLF Forum](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/).

A CFP will be issued by late April. [Stay tuned](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/ndsa-digipres16/) for more information!
