## Digital Preservation 2017: "Preservation is Political"

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) will hold its annual conference, _**Digital Preservation 2017: “Preservation is Political,”**_ in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, **October 25-26, 2017**.

Digital Preservation is the major meeting and conference of the NDSA—open to members and non-members alike—focusing on tools, techniques, theories and methodologies for digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, the content lifecycle, and related issues. Our 2017 meeting is once again held in partnership with our host organization, the Digital Library Federation (DLF). DLF's October 22nd [pre-conference](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2017forum/dlflac/) event (bringing together HBCUs and liberal arts colleges) and the [2017 DLF Forum](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2017forum/) (23-24 October) are all happening in the same location.


### About the NDSA and Digital Preservation 2017

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance is a consortium of [more than 160 organizations](http://ndsa.org/members-list/) committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. _Digital Preservation 2017_ ([#digipres17](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digipres17&src=typd)) will help to chart future directions for both the NDSA and digital stewardship, and is expected to be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field.

The conference will be held at the [Westin Convention Center](http://www.westinpittsburgh.com/) “where downtown buzz meets restorative sleep”, just blocks from historic [Market Square](http://marketsquarepgh.com/), [The Andy Warhol Museum](http://www.warhol.org/), boutiques, restaurants, and nightlife. The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event, and will operate under the DLF Forum’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/about/code-of-conduct/).
