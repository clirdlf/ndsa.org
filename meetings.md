## Digital Preservation 2016: "Building Communities of Practice"
Mark your calendars for November 9-10, 2016! [Registration](https://www.conftool.pro/dlf2016/) is open now, and we hope to see you in Milwaukee, just after the closing of the [2016 DLF Forum](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/)!

This year's conference will be the first organized in partnership with our new host organization, the [Digital Library Federation](https://diglib.org/) (DLF). *Digital Preservation* is the major meeting of the NDSA—open to [NDSA members](http://ndsa.diglib.org/members-list/) and non-members alike—focusing on tools, techniques, theories and methodologies for digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, the content lifecycle, and related issues.  Stay tuned here, at [@NDSA2](https://twitter.com/ndsa2) and [#digipres16](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digipres16&src=typd) on Twitter, and at the [DLF Forum website](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/ndsa-digipres16/) for more information!

### More Info

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance is a consortium of [more than 160 organizations](http://ndsa.diglib.org/members-list/) committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. Digital Preservation 2016 ([#digipres16](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digipres16&src=typd)) will help to chart future directions for both the NDSA and digital stewardship, and is expected to be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field.

Our revived conference will be held at the historic [Pfister Hotel](http://www.thepfisterhotel.com/), just blocks from Lake Michigan, the [Milwaukee Art Museum](http://mam.org/), restaurants, and nightlife. The hotel has an incredible Victorian art collection, an artist-in-residence program, and a spa.
