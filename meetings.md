## Digital Preservation 2016
*Digital Preservation* is the major meeting and conference of the NDSA, open to [NDSA members](http://ndsa.diglib.org/members-list/) and non-members alike, and focusing on digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, and related issues.

Our [2016 conference](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/ndsa-digipres16/) will be the first organized in partnership with the [Digital Library Federation](https://diglib.org/). Mark your calendars for November 9-10, 2016, and we'll see you at the historic [Pfister Hotel](http://www.thepfisterhotel.com/) in Milwaukee, WI, just after the closing of the [2016 DLF Forum](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/).

*Digital Preservation 2016* ([#digipres16](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digipres16&src=typd)) will help to chart future directions for the NDSA, and is expected to be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field.

### Call for Proposals: Digital Preservation 2016: "Building Communities of Practice"
The National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) invites proposals for Digital Preservation 2016, to be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 9-10 November 2016.

Digital Preservation is the major meeting and conference of the NDSA—open to members and non-members alike—focusing on tools, techniques, theories and methodologies for digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, the content lifecycle, and related issues. Our 2016 meeting will be the first held in partnership with our new host organization, the Digital Library Federation (DLF). Separate calls are being issued for the [DLF Liberal Arts Colleges Pre-Conference](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/dlf-liberal-arts-colleges-preconference/) (6 November) and [2016 DLF Forum](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/) (7-9 November)—all happening in the same location: https://diglib.org/DLFforum2016/

Proposals are [due by May 15th](https://conftool.pro/dlf2016/) at 11:59pm Pacific Time.  

**About the NDSA and Digital Preservation 2016:**

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance is a consortium of [more than 160 organizations](http://ndsa.diglib.org/members-list/) committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. Digital Preservation 2016 ([#digipres16](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digipres16&src=typd)) will help to chart future directions for both the NDSA and digital stewardship, and is expected to be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field.

The conference will be held at the historic [Pfister Hotel](http://www.thepfisterhotel.com/), just blocks from Lake Michigan, the [Milwaukee Art Museum](http://mam.org/), restaurants, and nightlife. The hotel has an incredible Victorian art collection, an artist-in-residence program, and a spa. The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event, and will operate under the DLF Forum’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/code-of-conduct/). Childcare subsidies for DLF Forum attendees also participating in Digital Preservation 2016 may be extended upon request. Contact [ndsa@diglib.org](ndsa@diglib.org) for more information.

**Submissions:**

250-word proposals describing the presentation/demo/poster are invited (500 words for full panel sessions). Please also include a 50-word short abstract for the program if your submission is selected. Submit proposals online: [https://conftool.pro/dlf2016/](https://conftool.pro/dlf2016/). Deadline: May 15th, 2016 at 11:59pm PT.

We especially encourage proposals that speak to our conference theme, “Building Communities of Practice.” Submissions are invited in the following lengths and formats:

Talks/Demos: Presentations and demonstrations are allocated 20 minutes each. Speakers should reserve time for interactive exchanges on next steps, possible NDSA community action, and discussion or debate.

Panels: Panel discussions with 4 or more speakers will be given a dedicated session. Organizers are especially encouraged to include as diverse an array of perspectives and voices as possible, and to reserve time for audience Q&A.  

Posters: Poster presenters will have the opportunity to interact with attendees one-on-one or in small groups, to exchange ideas and engage in conversation. (Guidelines for poster sizes will be provided on acceptance.)

Lunchtime Working Group Meetings: NDSA working and interest group chairs are invited to propose group meetings or targeted collaboration sessions. (Lunch provided.)

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by NDSA’s volunteer Program Committee. Presenters will be notified in July and guaranteed a registration slot at the conference.

**US Presidential Election Notice:**

Attendees arriving early for the DLF Forum (November 7-9) will want to plan ahead for early/absentee voting in the 2016 US Presidential Election.
