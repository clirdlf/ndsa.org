### **About the NDSA and Digital Preservation 2020:**

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance is a consortium of more than 220 organizations committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. Digital Preservation 2020 ([#digipres20](https://twitter.com/hashtag/digipres20)) intended to help to chart future directions for both the NDSA and digital stewardship, and was expected to be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field.

The conference will be held at the beautiful [Renaissance Baltimore Harborplace Hotel](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bwish-renaissance-baltimore-harborplace-hotel/), on November 11-12, 2020, in Baltimore, Maryland.

The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event, and operates under the DLF Forumâ€™s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/code).
