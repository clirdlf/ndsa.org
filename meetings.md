<img alt="meetings" width="710" height="270" src='{{ "/images/NDSA-DigitalPreservation-2018_FacebookHeader_Final.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}'>

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) invites proposals for **Digital Preservation 2018: “In/visible Work”** to be held in Henderson, NV, October 17-18, 2018.

Digital Preservation is the major meeting and conference of the NDSA—open to members and non-members alike—focusing on tools, techniques, theories and methodologies for digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, the content lifecycle, and related issues. Our 2018 meeting is held in partnership with our host organization, the Digital Library Federation (DLF). Separate calls are being issued for **[Learn@DLF](https://forum2018.diglib.org/learndlf/)** (October 14) and **[2018 DLF Forum](https://forum2018.diglib.org/)** (October 15-17)—all happening in the same location.

**[Proposals are due by May 7 at 11:59pm Pacific Time.](https://www.conftool.pro/dlf2018/)**

**Submissions:**
250-word proposals describing the presentation/demo/poster are invited (500 words for full panel sessions). Please also include a 50-word short abstract for the program if your submission is selected. Submit proposals online: [https://conftool.pro/dlf2018/](https://conftool.pro/dlf2018/).

**Deadline:** May 7th, 2018 at 11:59pm PT.

We especially encourage proposals that speak to our conference theme, **“In/visible Work.”**

Digital preservation efforts are supported by deep and complex infrastructures of people, organizations, software, technology, and standards. When these components align, preservation and access of digital materials may appear to be an effortless and seamless process — however, much of the work to collect, acquire, build, maintain, describe, and preserve digital collections is hidden from primary stakeholders and end users alike. This year, DigiPres 2018 invites presentations and workshops around the theme of “In/visible Work,” which seek to highlight the many layers and labors of digital preservation. Along with other digital preservation topics, the program committee is particularly interested in presentations that address:
- Labor & workforce development;
- Underrepresented people, collections and communities;
- Maintenance and the work of digital maintainers;
- Tech-debt, “degralesence,” and retroactive labor;
- Financial sustainability, environmental resources, and social costs of technologies;
- Storage commitments, contracts and costs;
- Models and strategies for post-custodial digital preservation; or
- Transparency, openness, and identity.

Submissions are invited in the following lengths and formats:

- **Talks/Demos:** Presentations and demonstrations are allocated 30 minutes each. Speakers should reserve time for interactive exchanges on next steps, possible NDSA community action, and discussion or debate.
- **Panels:** Panel discussions with 4 or more speakers will be given a dedicated session. "Manels"/all-male panels will not be accepted into the conference and proposals involving a diversity of speakers will be looked on favorably by the committee
- **Workshops:** Hands-on training sessions on specific tools, techniques, workflows, or concepts. All workshop organizers are asked to provide details on technology needs and learning outcomes for participants. Workshops are allotted 90 minutes.
- **Minute Madness/Posters:** Share your ideas in 60 seconds or less as part of the opening plenary of the conference. Presenters will have the option to display posters during the reception that follows. (Guidelines for poster sizes will be provided on acceptance.)
- **Lunchtime Working Group Meetings:** NDSA working and interest group chairs are invited to propose group meetings or targeted collaboration sessions. (Lunch provided.)

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by NDSA’s volunteer Program Committee. Presenters will be notified in June and guaranteed a registration slot at the conference.

### Keynote: Snowden Becker
[Snowden Becker](https://snowdenbecker.com/) will open Digital Preservation 2018 with a talk entitled “**To See Ourselves as Others See Us: On Archives, Visibility, and Value**.”

Becker manages the graduate degree program in audiovisual archiving and preservation in the [Department of Information Studies](https://is.gseis.ucla.edu/programs/graduate-degree-programs/mlis-specializations) at UCLA, where she also [teaches](https://snowdenbecker.com/courses-and-syllabi/) courses in preservation and archival administration. She previously worked at Academy Film Archive, J. Paul Getty Museum, and Japanese American National Museum. Becker is pursuing a PhD in Information Science at University of Texas at Austin. She has an MLIS from UCLA Graduate School of Education & Information Studies and a BFA from Maryland Institute, College of Art.

Snowden Becker’s research interests focus on how audiovisual materials are integrated into, accessed, and preserved as part of our larger cultural heritage. Her forthcoming dissertation, Keeping the Pieces: Evidence management and archival practice in law enforcement, addresses the property room as a type of archive, and examines how audiovisual recordings and file-based media are managed alongside material evidence in law enforcement organizations. That work has led into additional research projects related to the creation, management, and preservation of audiovisual evidence, including an [IMLS-funded National Forum](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/re-43-16-0053-16) on data management needs arising from large-scale video recording programs such as police body-worn cameras.

### Digital Preservation Mentorship Program
Stay tuned for more information about a lightweight conference mentorship program! When registration opens, attendees will be able to sign up to be mentors, mentees, or both.
