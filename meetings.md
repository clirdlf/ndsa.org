## Digital Preservation 2017

Digital Preservation is the NDSA’s major meeting and conference—open to members and non-members alike—focusing on digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, and related issues. This year, it will be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 25-26, 2017, immediately following the [DLF Forum](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2017forum/).

### About the Conference

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance is a consortium of [more than 160 organizations](http://ndsa.diglib.org/members-list/) committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. Digital Preservation 2017 will help to chart future directions for both the NDSA and digital stewardship, and is expected to be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field.

The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event, and will operate under the DLF Forum’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/code-of-conduct/).
