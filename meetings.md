## Digital Preservation 2017

Digital Preservation is the NDSA’s major meeting and conference—open to members and non-members alike—focusing on digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, and related issues. This year, it will be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 25-26, 2017.

### Call for Planning Committee Volunteers

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance calls for volunteers from [NDSA member organizations](/members-list) to join the Planning Committee for Digital Preservation 2017.

Logistical arrangements will be handled by the Digital Library Federation, so that this committee can focus more fully on the program for [#digipres17](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23digipres17&src=typd). Duties involve defining the vision for the event, drafting and circulating a CFP, coordinating the review and selection of proposals, crafting and publicizing the schedule, and collaborating with the DLF Forum planning committee to make this  conference partnership a success. We anticipate monthly group calls and regular email exchanges April-October.

This is an opportunity to help shape a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field of digital preservation—as well as to set the tone and direction for future NDSA events. Join us!

Volunteers from NDSA member organizations are asked to [complete this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWd-jrTIGIBqccaCgp7ytYOTvO3B9K4huJXNN7k-jy4v-G4Q/viewform?c=0&w=1) by **Monday, March 6th**.
