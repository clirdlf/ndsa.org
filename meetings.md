## Digital Preservation 2016
*Digital Preservation* is the major meeting and conference of the NDSA, open to [NDSA members](http://ndsa.diglib.org/members-list/) and non-members alike, and focusing on digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, and related issues.

Our [2016 conference](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/ndsa-digipres16/) will be the first organized in partnership with the [Digital Library Federation](https://diglib.org/). Mark your calendars for November 9-10, 2016, and we'll see you at the historic [Pfister Hotel](http://www.thepfisterhotel.com/) in Milwaukee, WI, just after the closing of the [2016 DLF Forum](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/).

*Digital Preservation 2016* ([#digipres16](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digipres16&src=typd)) will help to chart future directions for the NDSA, and is expected to be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field.

### Call for Proposals
A CFP will be issued by mid April. Stay tuned here, at [@NDSA2](https://twitter.com/ndsa2) on Twitter, and at the [DLF Forum website](https://www.diglib.org/forums/2016forum/ndsa-digipres16/) for more information!
