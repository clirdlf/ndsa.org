Our annual Innovation Awards were established by the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) to recognize and encourage innovation in the field of digital preservation stewardship. These awards highlight and commend creative individuals, projects, organizations, and future stewards demonstrating originality and excellence in their contributions to the field of digital preservation.

The program is administered by an NDSA Working Group, which includes members drawn from the former [Innovation Interest Group](http://ndsa.org/working-groups/innovation/).

## 2018 NDSA Innovation Awards: Nominations Open & Join Our Working Group! 
The NDSA is looking for participants in the 2018 NDSA Innovation Awards Working Group. Working group members encourage nominations during the nominations period and get together on a conference call early in September to talk about and get consensus on the award selections. 

Past experience has shown this to be a wonderful opportunity to see the wide range of innovative people and projects in the NDSA community. 

If you’re interested in participating in the working group, or have any questions about the awards or the awards process, please reply to the list or to Sheila Morrissey at sheila dot morrissey at ithaka dot org.

A reminder also to be sure to post your [nominations for the 2018 NDSA Innovation Awards](https://ndsa.org//2018/06/14/nominations-open-for-ndsa-2018-innovation-awards.html) by August 31.

## 2017 NDSA Innovation Award Winners

Our latest awardees were [announced](http://ndsa.org/2017/10/25/announcing-the-2017-ndsa-award-winners.html) at *Digital Preservation 2017* in Pittsburgh on October 25, 2017.

**Future Steward: Elizabeth England.** Elizabeth is recognized for her work as a National Digital Stewardship Residency (NDSR) resident at JHU’s Sheridan Libraries, which has significantly streamlined and advanced the JHU archives’ born-digital processing workflow and has motivated the Libraries to pursue grant funding to develop technology that will allow the community to appraise digital visual content in a more sophisticated way using computer vision techniques such as perceptual hashing.

**Individual: Rebecca Guenther.** Rebecca is recognized for nurturing conversations among international library stakeholders, conversations that led to the development of MODS, MADS and the enhancement of MARC, helping to build a solid foundation for discovery metadata. All of us in the preservation community have benefited from her leadership in the development of PREMIS metadata for digital preservation.

**Individual: Karen Cariani.** Karen is recognized for leadership that was crucial in forging a collaboration with the Library of Congress to steward the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, an initiative that has digitized nearly 50,000 hours of historic programming from more than 100 stations.  She has been an advocate for collaboration in the development and adoption of shared open-source solutions for digital stewardship, a leader in the NDSA and Hydra/Samvera community, as well as in the project to enhance the Avalon project with support for PBCore, and in developing open-source solutions for speech-to-text and audio waveform analysis.

**Organization: Digital Preservation Network.** Beyond DPN’s core mission of ensuring the secure preservation of stored content by leveraging a heterogeneous network that spans diverse geographic, technical, and institutional environments, the organization is recognized for its creation, with partner AVPreserve, of its Digital Preservation Workflow Curriculum.  The curriculum/workshop series provides a bridge between the desire to participate in digital preservation projects and the capacity to connect local content and resources to that aim, providing a flexible framework for guiding an organization through the necessary decision making processes for establishing a sustainable digital preservation workflow.

**Project: ePADD.** The ePADD project is recognized for developing an effective, useful, accessible tool that has significantly lowered technical and other resource barriers to appraising, acquiring, processing, and making accessible large email collections for individuals and museums, archives, and libraries, both large and small.  It has served as well, as an effective demonstration of the concrete possibilities of working with born-digital textual collections.  The project team have also been noted for fostering open collaboration, community-building, and support.

**Educator: George Coulbourne.** George is recognized for having established, while at the LOC, the Digital Preservation Outreach and Education (DPOE) program (now a network  of 217 digital preservation topical trainers across 33 states in the U.S., the District of Columbia, Australia, and New Zealand) to advance the practice of digital preservation through professional development opportunities such as the three-day DPOE Train-the-Trainer Workshop. The community recognizes his accomplishment in pioneering the National Digital Stewardship Residency (NDSR) program in collaboration with IMLS to cultivate nationwide talent in digital stewardship through a year-long residency that pairs emerging information professionals with cultural heritage institutions facing an array of digital preservation challenges.

**Educator: Dorothea Salo.** Dorothea is recognized for partnering with Wisconsin libraries — the Cedarburg Public Library, the Wisconsin School for the Deaf, Mineral Point Library and Archives, and the WYOU community television station in Madison — to provide resources and assist in the digitization of at-risk materials.  Her development projects, RADD (Recovering Analog and Digital Data), PROUD (Portable Recovery of Unique Data), and PRAVDA (Portably Reformat Audio and Video to Digital from Analog), have extended the reach of digitization and preservation tools to those without the resources of large-scale memory institutions.
