Our annual Innovation Awards were established by the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) to recognize and encourage innovation in the field of digital preservation stewardship. These awards highlight and commend creative individuals, projects, organizations, and future stewards demonstrating originality and excellence in their contributions to the field of digital preservation. The program is administered by a committee drawn from members of the NDSA [Innovation Working Group](/innovation/).

## 2015 NDSA Innovation Award Winners

The nomination period was open from May 12 - June 30, 2015. Our latest awardees were [announced](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2015/10/announcing-the-2015-innovation-award-winners/) on October 15, 2015.

**Future Steward: Lauren Work, VCU Libraries.** Lauren is recognized for her work on several projects with the aim of giving VCU Libraries' collections greater exposure and connecting the Library with the Richmond community. In her short time at VCU, sheâ€™s created collaborations and working relationships inside and outside of the library to expose hidden collections in order to further digital preservation.

**Individual: Ben Welsh, LA Times.** Ben, a reporter and developer at the LA Times, created Past Pages, a project that archives the homepage of a broad swath of new sites' homepages every hour. This project is something he does in his spare time and it is something he was able to raise money for via Kickstarter. It is an example of the kinds of innovative creative interdisciplinary work that can happen in digital stewardship.

**Organization: Digital POWRR.** Digital POWRR is recognized for offering standalone advice for implementing a digital preservation program on a need-based spectrum, spanning no funds or technical assistance up though all-in-one preservation and dissemination systems.

**Project: Documenting Ferguson.** Documenting Ferguson seeks to preserve and make accessible the digital media captured and created by community members, representing diverse perspectives on the events in Ferguson and the resulting social dialogue. By providing long-term access to digital media surrounding recent historical events, this project helps set a new framework for digital preservation.
