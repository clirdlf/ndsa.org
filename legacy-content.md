Until 2016, some working documentation from NDSA groups was maintained on the NDSA Wiki at https://wiki.diglib.org/NDSA:Main_Page. Since 2016, those activities have often been captured using Google Drive and final products made available on the NDSA website or [NDSA OSF repository](https://osf.io/4d567/). Meeting notes for some groups are also available on the NDSA website. 

After a review in 2019, the Wiki was retired, as it was no longer actively being used by NDSA groups or membership.  Legacy content was migrated to this website (ndsa.org), current shared group locations, and remains available via an archived copy of the [NDSA Wiki at the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20190425190313/https://wiki.diglib.org/NDSA:Main_Page).
