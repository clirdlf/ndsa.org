## Membership

### Should my organization join the NDSA?

If your organization has an active digital preservation program and wants to work with other experts in the field, then yes, your organization should join the NDSA. Members will share the [stated values](/about/foundational-principles/) of the NDSA. Consortia, nonprofits, commercial entities and international organizations are all welcome to [apply for membership](/get-involved/) or join as an [Affiliate](/membership/join/).  

### How can my organization check the status of our application?

Our [Leadership Team](/leadership/) evaluates membership applications on a monthly basis. If it has been more than a month since you completed your application, please feel free to check in: <mailto:ndsa@diglib.org>

### What commitment is expected if my organization joins the NDSA?

Members are expected to engage actively in digital stewardship and share lessons learned and practical knowledge about ensuring long-term access to digital materials. [Interest Groups and Working Groups](/working-groups) are the primary mechanism through which the NDSA accomplishes its [goals](/values). Details are provided on the [membership page](/membership/join/). 

### What are the benefits of joining the NDSA?

Members have direct contact with other experts in digital stewardship and an opportunity to affect national digital stewardship strategies and initiatives. Participation in NDSA Interest and Working Group activities provides practical benefit to local programs and shared results. More details of benefits are listed on the [membership page](/membership/join/).

### Does the NDSA provide funding?

The NDSA does not provide funding for projects or building tools and infrastructure, although some of our member organizations do. Look for [relevant funding opportunities](https://www.diglib.org/opportunities/) in data curation and digitization from NDSA's host organization, [CLIR](https://www.clir.org/) and [DLF](https://www.diglib.org/).

### How does NDSA relate to the DLF? To CLIR?

The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) and the [Digital Library Federation(DLF)](https://www.diglib.org/) believe strongly in NDSA's mission and [foundational principles](/about/foundational-principles/). NDSA is financially supported by the DLF, which also provides communications infrastructure, staff time, and provides a representative who participates in [Leadership](/about/leadership/) calls. [CLIR](https://www.clir.org/) is the parent organization of the DLF, but DLF itself runs on independent membership fees. If you like what DLF is doing to support digital stewardship at no cost to NDSA members, please [join DLF](https://www.diglib.org/members/join/) and contribute!

## Participation

### What is the difference between an Interest Group and a Working Group?
The NDSA has established Interest Groups focusing on broad areas of digital preservation, out of which smaller Working Groups often emerge. All NDSA member organizations commit to providing participants for one or more groups. NDSA participants may propose new Interest Groups (IGs) and Working Groups (WGs) to the Leadership Team, in order to discuss mutual interests, and advance joint projects.

### Which groups are right for my organization?

The answer depends on what exactly your organizational goals and needs are. It is generally best to try to match the right people in your organization with the right NDSA group. For example, developers and IT staff and administrators are a great fit for the [Infrastructure Interest Group](/groups/infrastructure/). Think about what your organization's strengths are and work from there. In general, the more directly the group's mission suits the individuals who participate from your organization, the more you, the NDSA, and the group benefit.

### How do we join a specific Interest Group or Working Group?

When organizations join the NDSA, they indicate which Interest Groups they would like to join, and which individuals will participate in each of those groups. Once a organization's application is approved, those people are added to the relevant listservs and can begin collaborating. Individuals at member organizations can also join other NDSA Interest Groups and Working Groups at any point. To join a particular group, contact <ndsa@diglib.org> or the [group's chair](/working-groups/) to let us know what member organization you represent and make your request.

### Can I switch to a different group?

Yes, people associated with NDSA member organizations can change Interest Groups and Working Groups at any point. Contact the [group's chair or co-chair](/working-groups/) if you have questions about making a switch.

### Can member organizations participate in more than one Interest Group or Working Group?

Definitely! We encourage participation on multiple Interest Groups and Working Groups. In most cases, it is best to have different people from a member organization participate in different groups. Ideally, the Interest Group or Working Group will be a direct and natural fit for the nature of each individual's role within your organization.
