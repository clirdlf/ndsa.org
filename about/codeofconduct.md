NDSA groups follow DLF’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/about/code-of-conduct/) as the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) acts as the host organization for both the Digital Library Federation (DLF) and NDSA.  

This website documents the procedures for reporting Code of Conduct violations or concerns for NDSA spaces based on where the incident occurs.
