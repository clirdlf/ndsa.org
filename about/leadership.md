<h3>Leadership Team</h3>
<p>The NDSA Leadership consists of the elected Coordinating Committee,  the chairs/co-chairs of the <a href="/working-groups/">Interest and Working Groups</a>, and a representative from the <a href="https://www.diglib.org/">Host Organization</a>. Together,
    the Coordinating Committee and the Interest and Working Group chairs work to articulate a long-term, strategic vision for NDSA. The Leadership group meets once a month online and in person once during the Digital Preservation Annual Conference.</p>

<p>Select activities of the Leadership group include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Approving new NDSA member applications.</li>
    <li>Creating and reviewing NDSA publications (e.g. The NDSA Agenda).</li>
    <li>Evaluating the effectiveness of the Interest and Working Groups and providing guidance and assistance to the Group chairs as appropriate. This can include recommending the creation, consolidation, or disbanding of Interest or Working Groups and working

<h2>Coordinating Committee</h2>
<p>Members may also pursue becoming a member of the Coordinating Committee (CC). Members of the Coordinating Committee serve a three-year elected position that works with the chairs of the Interest and Working groups on the strategic goals of the NDSA. Details
    about the purpose, charge, and expectations of the committee are recorded in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tjGqH0B6T7kBti0Un6US_3pTnprdou-6O-SjZgkfDro/edit?usp=sharing">Coordinating Committee Information</a> document. The primary

    provide strategic leadership for the organization. Committee members serve staggered terms of three years.
