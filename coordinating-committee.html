<h3>Leadership Team</h3>
<p>The NDSA Leadership consists of the elected Coordinating Committee, and the chairs/co-chairs of the <a href="/working-groups/">Interest and Working Groups</a>, and a representative from the <a href="https://www.diglib.org/">Host Organization</a>. Together, the Coordinating Committee and the Interest and Working Group chairs work to articulate a long-term, strategic vision for NDSA. The Leadership group meets once a month online and in person once during the Digital Preservation Annual Conference.</p> 

</p>Select activities of the Leadership group include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Approving new NDSA member applications.</li>
<li>Creating and reviewing NDSA publications (e.g. The NDSA Agenda).</li>

Members of the Coordinating Committee serve a three-year elected position that works with the chairs of the Interest and Working groups on the strategic goals of the NDSA. Details about the purpose, charge, and expectations of the committee are recorded in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tjGqH0B6T7kBti0Un6US_3pTnprdou-6O-SjZgkfDro/edit?usp=sharing">Coordinating Committee Information</a> document.
