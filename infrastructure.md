The Infrastructure Working Group works to identify and share emerging practices around the development and maintenance of tools and systems for the curation, preservation, storage, hosting, migration, and similar activities supporting the long term preservation of digital content.

## The NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation

The "[Levels of Digital Preservation](/activities/levels-of-digital-preservation/)" being refined now by the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA), is a tiered set of recommendations on how organizations should begin to build or enhance their digital preservation activities. A work in progress, it is intended to be a relatively easy-to-use set of guidelines useful not only for those just beginning to think about preserving their digital assets, but also for institutions planning the next steps in enhancing their existing digital preservation systems and workflows. It allows institutions to assess the level of preservation achieved for specific materials in their custody. It is not designed to assess the robustness of digital preservation programs as a whole since it does not cover such things as policies, staffing, or organizational support. The guidelines are organized into five functional areas that are at the heart of digital preservation systems: storage and geographic location, file fixity and data integrity, information security, metadata, and file formats.

## Other Activities

The group is also surveying emerging practices around the use of large-scale and cloud storage platforms for digital preservation. Future projects may include:

- Promoting the collaborative development of free and open source tools, using sustainable software development processes and to create a structure for the support of the software over time
- Exploring the use of computer forensics tools for the appraisal, processing, and preservation of born-digital collections
- Encouraging communities with highly specialized needs (e.g., geospatial, datasets, observational data) to develop storage networks or access services that can serve the entire community.
