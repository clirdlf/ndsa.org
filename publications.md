This is a non-exclusive list of recent NDSA reports, survey outcomes, and articles. See our [overview of activities](/activities/) for more, and don't miss the latest NDSA [National Agenda for Digital Stewardship](/national-agenda/).

## Selected Reports

#### "Checking Your Digital Content: What is Fixity, and When Should I be Checking It?
A [report](/documents/NDSA-Fixity-Guidance-Report-final100214.pdf) (PDF, 150 KB) written by a joint action team of the [Infrastructure](/working-groups/infrastructure/) and [Standards and Practices](/working-groups/standards-and-practices/) Working Groups that addresses the need for guidance on fixity and audit and repair strategies as a core goal of digital preservation. This document aims to help stewards answer these questions in a way that makes sense for their organization based on their needs and resources.

#### "Geospatial Data Stewardship: Key Online Resources"
A [report](/documents/NDSA_Geo-stewardship-key-resources_final030414.pdf) (PDF) of the Geospatial Content Team that lists online resources that highlight key concepts and practices supporting the preservation and stewardship of digital geospatial data and information. The resources offer a starting point to methods, tools and approaches across the information lifecycle to assist in understanding current best practices in the stewardship of geospatial data. These resources will be regularly updated online at the ["Geospatial Data Stewardship: Key Online Resources"](/working-groups/content/geospatial-data-stewardship/) web page.

#### "The Benefits and Risks of the PDF/A-3 File Format for Archival Institutions"
A [report](/documents/NDSA_PDF_A3_report_final022014.pdf) (pdf) created by the [Standards and Practices Working Group](/working-groups/standards-and-practices) that takes a measured look at the costs and benefits of the widespread use of the PDF/A-3 format, especially as it effects content arriving in collecting institutions. It provides background on the technical development of the specification, identifies specific scenarios under which the format might be used and suggests policy prescriptions for collecting institutions to consider. More information in a [2/20/14 blog post](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2014/02/new-ndsa-report-the-benefits-and-risks-of-the-pdfa-3-file-format-for-archival-institutions/) on the Signal.

#### Web Archiving Surveys
The [report](/documents/NDSA_USWebArchivingSurvey_2013-Full.pdf) (PDF, 442 KB) on the results of the Fall 2011 survey of U.S. organizations engaged in web archiving or in the process of planning a web archive was published in Fall 2013. The goal of the survey was to better understand the landscape of web archiving activities in the United States, including identifying the organizations or individuals involved, the types of web content being preserved, the tools and services being used, and the types of access being provided. A list of the survey questions is available [here](/documents/USWebArchivingSurvey.pdf) (PDF, 272 KB).

A [report](/documents/NDSA_USWebArchivingSurvey_2013.pdf) (PDF, 1010 KB) on the results of the Fall 2013 survey of U.S. organizations engaged in web archiving or in the process of planning a web archive was published in Fall 2014. While this survey documents the current state of U.S. web archiving initiatives, comparison with the results of the 2011-2012 survey enables an analysis of emerging trends. This report therefore describes the current state of the field, tracks the evolution of the field over the last few years, and forecasts future activities and developments. A list of the survey questions is available [here](/documents/ndsa_web_archiving_survey_2013.pdf) (PDF, 196 KB).

#### Issues in the Appraisal and Selection of Geospatial Data
A [report](/documents/NDSA_AppraisalSelection_report_final102413.pdf) (PDF, 554 KB) of the Geospatial Content Team of the [Content Working Group](/working-groups/content/) considering both appraisal and selection activities as they effect decisions defining geospatial content of enduring value to the nation.

#### Staffing for Effective Digital Preservation
A [report](/documents/NDSA-Staffing-Survey-Report-Final122013.pdf) (PDF, 1.8 MB) created by the [Standards and Practices Working Group](/working-groups/standards-and-practices/), sharing what the group learned by surveying 85 institutions with a mandate to preserve digital content about how they staffed and organized their preservation functions. The [poster](/documents/NDSA-staff-survey-poster-ipres2012.pdf) (PDF, 1.2 MB) describing this survey won second place at iPRES 2012 More information in a [12/16/13 blog post](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2013/12/just-released-staffing-for-effective-digital-preservation-an-ndsa-report/) on the Signal.

## Selected Articles

#### Storage Survey
The [NDSA Infrastructure Working Group](/working-groups/infrastructure/) conducted a 2011 survey of member institutions on their institutions' current long-term archival storage for digital materials and projected storage needs for the future. The information from this survey was shared though a series of blog posts and an article and was published in D-Lib article in the May/June 2013 edition, "[NDSA Storage Report: Reflections on National Digital Stewardship Alliance Member Approaches to Preservation Storage Technologies.](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may13/altman/05altman.html)" Early analysis of the survey is available here.
