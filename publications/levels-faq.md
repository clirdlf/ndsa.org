### Questions and Answers

#### What are the NDSA Levels of Preservation?
The NDSA Levels of Preservation are a simple tool that institutions can use to assess their digital preservation maturity. Looking specifically at the technical aspects of digital preservation implementation, they are organized into five functional areas that are at the heart of digital preservation systems (storage, integrity, control, metadata and content) and describe four different levels of capability. Level one typically describes the first steps an institution might take towards understanding the digital content to be preserved. The levels get progressively more advanced up to level 4 which articulates some of the more advanced activities that need to be in place in order to fully implement digital preservation.

The NDSA Levels were first created in 2013 and were widely adopted across the globe. Five years on, it was decided that the Levels should be reviewed and updated and a call was made for volunteers to get involved in this process. Version 2 of the NDSA Levels was released in 2019 alongside related reports and outputs from the various working groups. More information about the reboot process is described by Bradley Daigle in the blog post Levels of Preservation Reboot Overview and Update.
Where can I find them?


#### The NDSA Levels can be found here:
https://ndsa.org//publications/levels-of-digital-preservation/

#### Who are they for? Who can use them?
The NDSA Levels of Preservation are freely available for anyone to use. They are a helpful benchmarking tool for any organization charged with managing digital information for the long term. Basic knowledge of digital preservation concepts and terminology is required, though working definitions of terms are also available [https://osf.io/vnc32/].

#### How were the NDSA Levels revised?
Five years after the publication of version 1, the NDSA made an open call for the international digital preservation community to help revise and update the Levels. Volunteers were asked what they were most interested in helping with and a number of different working groups were formed, each with a different charge. One group focused on revising and updating the Levels and other others worked on related tasks, for example surveying the community to gather feedback and establish how they were used, or creating an assessment tool to help people use them in the future. Further information about each of the working groups can be found in a blog post by Bradley Daigle: https://www.dpconline.org/blog/levels-of-preservation-reboot-overview-and-update

The revision process itself was carried out by a group led by Karen Cariani over a period of just over a year. The group had regular virtual meetings and worked systematically through the existing grid, discussing any changes that should be made. Feedback from the survey carried out by the Implementation group was incorporated into the process along with feedback on early drafts shared with the other working groups and the wider community. Further information about the revision process and what has changed can be found in a blog post by Jenny Mitcham ‘Introducing the new NDSA Levels of Preservation’. 

#### What has changed in version 2?
Version 2 of the Levels is similar to the original version in many ways. Just like the original, it can be printed out on one page and is quick and easy to use. It maintains the simplicity of the original levels and the grid display and maintains the same number of rows and columns. An effort was made to ensure that each level represented a logical and incremental improvement on the previous one. This was particularly the case for the ‘Metadata’ row which did not demonstrate a clear logical progression in Version 1. Version 2 includes some changes to the language used (for example, focussing more broadly on  ‘digital content’ rather than ‘data’), changes to the names of the row headings (keeping them short and snappy) and column names (a logical reordering and a focus on sustaining rather than repairing content).

Further information about the revision process and what has changed can be found in a blog post by Jenny Mitcham ‘Introducing the new NDSA Levels of Preservation’. 

#### How will the Levels be maintained?
Digital preservation is a field that evolves over time and it is important that the NDSA Levels remain useful and relevant. The working group involved in the revision of the Levels were careful to build some measure of future proofing into version 2, but inevitably they will need updating again in the future.

### Using the Levels 

#### How can I use the Levels?
You are encouraged to use the Levels in any way that is helpful to you. ‘Using the Levels of Digital Preservation: an overview for V2.0’ describes some of the ways it can be used for education and advocacy or planning and assessment. The report ‘Preliminary results from the “Using the Levels of Preservation Survey”’ is also helpful in providing summary data on how respondents utilised version 1 of the Levels. They are designed to be cumulative - you need to have implemented level 1 before you can move on to level 2. You can then see what you need to do next in order to move forward with digital preservation. 

Often, organizations use the Levels to identify actions to get started or to map out their current position with regard to digital preservation. The Levels Implementation Guide includes suggestions to help you create a development plan or roadmap to move forward, carrying out some internal advocacy activities within your organisation to get the necessary buy in, or writing a more formal business case for digital preservation. 

#### What is the Levels Assessment Tool?
When you are ready, there is an NDSA Levels  Assessment Tool to help you complete a self-assessment and to record and visualize your results. This Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) can be downloaded and used to score each listed item or action within the grid. The use of colours within the spreadsheet allows you to see at a glance which areas are solved and which need further work. The accompanying report ‘Using the Levels of Digital Preservation as an Assessment Tool’ gives further guidance on how to carry out an assessment using the tool, and details some of the actions that could be taken after carrying out a self assessment.

The results of your NDSA Levels assessment can certainly help feed into this process, providing some of the evidence you may need to demonstrate where you are now and how you could improve.

#### What are the benefits of using the Levels Assessment Tool?
The self-assessment helps you understand where you are and to highlight gaps you might need to fill. Like any form of self-assessment, benchmarking or maturity modelling, the main benefit of using the NDSA Levels is an increased understanding of your current digital preservation capabilities and a sense of what you might need to put in place in order to make further progress. Having that understanding will enable you to consider future priorities and also to carry out internal advocacy activities. 

Note that like any self-assessment task, the Levels are best used iteratively over time rather than as a one-off exercise. Aim to repeat the assessment at regular intervals, perhaps in line with an annual assessment or regular strategic planning exercise. It can be encouraging to see where improvements have been made, and equally important to be able to demonstrate where progress has been slow, allowing for future resources to be allocated in the areas where the need is greatest. A self assessment exercise like the levels Assessment Tool can be a stepping stone towards other activities to help your organisation move forward in digital preservation. 

There are other self assessment or maturity modelling frameworks in digital preservation but the benefits of using the NDSA Levels specifically are that they focus on the technological aspects of your program, they are easy to understand and quick to use, and they are widely recognised and adopted. Working to complete your self-assessment can provide a helpful prompt when having conversations with IT or solution providers about how digital archives are stored and managed.If you want to talk to others in the digital preservation community about the NDSA Levels, there is a high chance they will understand what you are talking about!
