The Levels of Digital Preservation (LoP) is a resource for digital preservation practitioners when building or evaluating their digital preservation program.  Originally created in 2013, Version 2.0 was released in 2018 along with additional supporting documentation and resources. 

The LoP Matrix, documentation, and supporting resources are provided on this page as well as in the [NDSA's OSF repository](https://osf.io/4d567/).  

For questions, please contact a member of the [LOP Working Group](/groups/levels-of-preservation/).

### Levels of Preservation Working Group
This work was done by the Levels of Preservation Working Group.  It is expected that the Levels of Digital Preservation will continue to be updated over time as additional feedback is received, experience is gained implementing its recommendations and as empirical research provides detailed information about data loss. For this reason, each iteration of the Levels will be versioned.
