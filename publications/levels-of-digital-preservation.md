The Levels of Digital Preservation (LoP) is a resource for digital preservation practitioners when building or evaluating their digital preservation program.  Originally created in 2013, Version 2.0 was released in 2019 along with additional supporting documentation and resources. 

The LoP Matrix, documentation, and supporting resources are provided on this page as well as in the [NDSA's OSF repository](https://osf.io/4d567/).  

This work was carried out by the Levels of Digital Preservation Working Group.  Find more information or questions, please contact a member of the [LOP Working Group](/groups/levels-of-preservation/).

### Levels of Digital Preservation V2.0 Matrix
The Levels of Digital Preservation Matrix, shown above in color, is available in both color and black and white on the OSF site. The Matrix should be used in association with the working definitions document which gives further explanation on terms used within the grid.   
* [Levels of Digital Preservation Matrix](https://osf.io/2mkwx/)
* [Working Definitions of Terms](https://osf.io/rynmf/)
* [Levels of Digital Preservation FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jxj7hlV9LNO0grucz88CSyk_WHrc_uAQB-EYJjJvexY/edit?usp=sharing)

### Implementation Guidelines
The Implementation Guidelines provide background information on the Levels of Digital Preservation project from 2013 and 2018, the thinkings of the group on changes that were made, working definitions of terms, and recommendations for implementing the LOP. 
* [Using the Levels of Digital Preservation: An Overview](https://osf.io/nt8u9/)
  
### Assessment Tool
The Assessment Tool is available to help you use the Levels of Digital Preservation.  This spreadsheet template can be downloaded and used to record and visualize your assessment results.  A guidance document is also available and describes how the tool should be used and provides two case studies of the Assessment Tool in use.  
* [Assessment Tool Documentation and Resources](https://osf.io/m2fek/)
* [Assessment Tool Template](https://osf.io/8ctpu/)

### Curatorial Guidance
A Digital Curation Decision Guide has been released that helps forms the basis of a series of decision points around collections and the implementation of a preservation strategy. The Guide has both a visual and prose version to explore from different angles the basic factors in complex infrastructure and collections management decisions.

### Training Slide Deck
A slide deck and accompanying instructions are provided for use if you would like to talk about the Levels of Digital Preservation to an audience.  Slides could be used for a full day workshop, a webinar, or just a quick infomercial like presentation.  The guide helps break down which slides may be most useful for each type of presentation, however feel free to use the slides that work for your purpose or audience.

### Feedback
It is expected that the Levels of Digital Preservation will continue to be updated over time as additional feedback is received, experience is gained implementing its recommendations, and as empirical research provides detailed information about data loss.  For this reason, each iteration of the Levels will be versiond. 

If you have feedback on the Levels Matrix or any of the related documents, please submit it to us using this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuS_uabpqSkSHpIsaam64ZEKDFIuZ1qZNaafXVvueIZsb8MA/viewform).
