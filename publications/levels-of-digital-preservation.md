The Levels of Digital Preservation (also referred to as the 'Levels') is a resource to help digital preservation practitioners build or assess their digital preservation program.  Originally created in 2013, Version 2.0 was released in 2019 along with additional supporting documentation and resources. 

The Levels of Preservation matrix, documentation, and supporting resources are available from the [NDSA's OSF repository](https://osf.io/4d567/) and linked from this page.  

Version 2.0 of the Levels was created by the Levels of Digital Preservation Working Group.  For more information, please contact a member of the [Levels Steering Group](/groups/levels-of-preservation/).

<!--### Levels of Preservation Working Group
This work was done by the Levels of Preservation Working Group.  It is expected that the Levels of Digital Preservation will continue to be updated over time as additional feedback is received, experience is gained implementing its recommendations and as empirical research provides detailed information about data loss. For this reason, each iteration of the Levels will be versioned.
