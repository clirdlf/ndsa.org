#### "Checking Your Digital Content: What is Fixity, and When Should I be Checking It?
- A [report](/documents/NDSA-Fixity-Guidance-Report-final100214.pdf) (PDF, 150 KB) written by a joint action team of the [Infrastructure](/working-groups/infrastructure/) and [Standards and Practices](/working-groups/standards-and-practices/) Working Groups that addresses the need for guidance on fixity and audit and repair strategies as a core goal of digital preservation. This document aims to help stewards answer these questions in a way that makes sense for their organization based on their needs and resources.

#### "Geospatial Data Stewardship: Key Online Resources"
- A [report](/documents/NDSA_Geo-stewardship-key-resources_final030414.pdf) (PDF) of the Geospatial Content Team that lists online resources that highlight key concepts and practices supporting the preservation and stewardship of digital geospatial data and information. The resources offer a starting point to methods, tools and approaches across the information lifecycle to assist in understanding current best practices in the stewardship of geospatial data. These resources will be regularly updated online at the ["Geospatial Data Stewardship: Key Online Resources"](/working-groups/content/geospatial-data-stewardship/) web page.

#### "The Benefits and Risks of the PDF/A-3 File Format for Archival Institutions"
- A [report](/documents/NDSA_PDF_A3_report_final022014.pdf) (pdf) created by the [Standards and Practices Working Group](/working-groups/standards-and-practices) that takes a measured look at the costs and benefits of the widespread use of the PDF/A-3 format, especially as it effects content arriving in collecting institutions. It provides background on the technical development of the specification, identifies specific scenarios under which the format might be used and suggests policy prescriptions for collecting institutions to consider. More information in a [2/20/14 blog post](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2014/02/new-ndsa-report-the-benefits-and-risks-of-the-pdfa-3-file-format-for-archival-institutions/) on the Signal.
