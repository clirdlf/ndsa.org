<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you manage and preserve content? If so, we’d like to know about your preservation storage infrastructure! The NDSA Preservation Storage Infrastructure Working Group is back again, with our latest iteration of the NSDA Preservation Storage Infrastructure survey. Please contribute to our longitudinal research designed to gain insight into how organizations worldwide use preservation storage to ensure long-term access to their digital content and to learn how real-world capacity and best practices differ.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The <a href="https://uark.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2fUJ73aqcHVYnno" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">will remain open until </span><b>November 22, 2023</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and should take approximately 30 minutes to complete. We will make our best effort to protect your individual responses so that no one will be able to connect your responses with you or your organization. Any personal information that could identify you or your organization will be removed or changed before survey results are made public. We will combine your responses along with the responses of others and make the aggregated results public in mid-2024. To assist with completing the survey all of the survey questions can be <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AWhwvMzs_MiZb7Ot7iFOxipNfCcBAnQ-/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viewed in advance</a>. </span></p>
