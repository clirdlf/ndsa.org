<p><em>Digital Preservation</em> is the NDSA’s major meeting and conference—open to members and non-members alike—focusing on digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, and related issues. This year, it will be held at the historic Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, <strong>9-10 November 2016</strong>, in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.diglib.org/dlf-events/2016forum/">2016 DLF Forum</a> (7-9 November).</p>
<p>Logistical arrangements will be handled by the Digital Library Federation, so that this committee can focus more fully on the program for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digipres16&#038;src=typd">#digipres16</a>. Duties involve defining the vision for the event, drafting and circulating a CFP, coordinating the review and selection of proposals, crafting and publicizing the schedule, and collaborating with the DLF Forum planning committee to make this first conference partnership a success. We anticipate monthly group calls and regular email exchanges April-October. The Digital Preservation 2016 Program Committee will be chaired by NDSA Coordinating Committee member <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2011/10/digital-preservation-pioneer-helen-tibbo/">Dr. Helen Tibbo</a>.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to help shape a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field of digital preservation—as well as to set the tone and direction for future NDSA events. Join us!</p>
<p>Volunteers from <a href="http://ndsa.org/members-list/">NDSA member organizations</a> are asked to <strong>respond by Monday, March 28th</strong>. Please send an expression of interest to <a href="mailto:ndsa@diglib.org">ndsa@diglib.org</a>. </p>
