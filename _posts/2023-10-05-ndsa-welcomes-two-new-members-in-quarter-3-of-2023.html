<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As of September 2023, the NDSA Leadership unanimously voted to welcome its two most recent applicants into the membership. Each new member brings a host of skills and experience to our group. Keep an eye out for them on your calls and be sure to give them a shout out. Please join me in welcoming our new members! To review our list of all members, you can see them </span><a href="https://ndsa.org/membership/members/"><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

They are still in the early stages of this process, but after attending a Digital POWRR Institute, they are on their way and are eager to join a group where they can both learn and share our experiences with others as they gain expertise.Â </span></p>
