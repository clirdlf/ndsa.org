<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is with great pleasure to announce that the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Levels of Digital Preservation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> work continues to roll out. In these waning days of 2020, the Curatorial Team of the Levels has released its first published edition of the </span><a href="https://osf.io/q8c47/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Digital Curation Decision Guide</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. This guide forms the basis of a series of decision points around collections and the implementation of a preservation strategy. It is not just for the preservation specialist but rather, it attempts to highlight the preservation implications of collections decisions. It is the group’s desire that the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Guide</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> will facilitate dialogue between and among stakeholders across a given organization and inculcate a preservation mindset without necessarily having to be a deep expert. It is also not prescriptive. It is a non-linear exploration of multiple vectors that make up curatorial decision-making such as collection development, intellectual and security considerations, and technical capacity. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Guide</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> has both a visual and prose version to explore from different angles the basic factors in complex infrastructure and collections management decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Decision Guide</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> will be extended in the future, linking up with other efforts such as actively maintained working definitions, policy frameworks and examples, as well as the revision of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Levels</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to thank the many people who gave us exceptional feedback along the way. This group started in late 2018 and worked for two years to craft something we hope will form a part of your organizational practice. In particular, I want to spotlight the work of the individuals who stuck it out to the very end:</span></p>

That said, we also understand that the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Digital Curation Decision Guide</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is just the beginning and that with increased use and refinement, we will need to update and improve on what we have started. We hope that you, the preservation community (broadly defined), use this guide to engage your colleagues and provide the clear pathways to preserving our cultural record.</span></p>
