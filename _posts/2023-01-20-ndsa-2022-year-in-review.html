<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we begin 2023 we wanted to take a moment to look back at NDSA activities over the past year.  Please take a look at the things we&#8217;ve accomplished and think about how you can participate this year!  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">NDSA Leadership</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This summer, NDSA <a href="https://ndsa.org/about/leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leadership</a> went through an facilitated exercise to discuss NDSA strategy and how we engage with the marketplace of digital preservation service providers. One result of this exercise is a refreshed </span><a href="https://ndsa.org/about/foundational-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">NDSA Foundational Strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which includes tweaks to our mission and vision statements, adds Transparency and Openness as values, and now includes operating principles based on our values. These new principles will be used as guidestones as we conclude this work on service provider engagement. In October, NDSA sponsored an open conversation on the Ithaka S+R report, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Effectiveness and Durability of Digital Preservation and Curation Systems</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. This conversation provided space for the community to react to the report and discuss its implications, you can read a </span><a href="https://ndsa.org/2022/12/16/reflections-from-the-open-conversation-on-the-ithaka-s+r-report-the-effectiveness-and-durability-of-digital-preservation-and-curation-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">summary on the NDSA News blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Membership Updates </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following our new quarterly membership review process, we welcomed a total of 15 new members, with 5 of those being international members from Africa (3), Iceland, and Mexico. We look forward to working with and learning from our new members.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As existing members, the new year is a good time to make sure your organization’s  </span><a href="https://ndsa.org/membership/orientation/"><span style="font-weight: 400">contact information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is up to date. A simple form is available to assist with this process.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Interest Groups </span></h2>
<h3><a href="https://ndsa.org/groups/content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Content Interest Group</span></a></h3>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">At our May meeting we officially said goodbye to Deb Verhoff and had an interesting discussion about the new forms of content that are created in news organizations and the implications thereof for digital preservation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dealing with content that has both cultural and ethical concerns, as well as offensive content was the topic of the presentation and discussion led by the University of Cape Town during the August meeting. Andrea Walker, an archivist from the University of Cape Town spoke to us about an ongoing digital curation project involving the ǂKhomani San.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Our last meeting of 2022 was a casual affair with new members to the NDSA (those who joined in 2022) coming to tell us about themselves and their organizations. We look forward to interacting with and learning from them during 2023.</span></li>

This is held once every 2 months and provides a forum for members of the community to drop in and discuss the Levels and ask questions. Specific topics covered within these sessions include a focus on community archives and their use of the levels and a discussion about documentation. Do come along to future ‘office hour’ sessions &#8211; we would love to see you there!
