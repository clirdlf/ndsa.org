<p dir="ltr">The NDSA Leadership group is spinning up a new group around NDSA Membership and invites you to consider volunteering for the Task Force on Membership Engagement and Recruitment. The focus of the Task Force will be to examine membership engagement, benefits/drawbacks of the current model type, and recruitment efforts of the NDSA. Through research and surveying members of the consortium, a primary goal of the Task Force is to provide recommendations that will move the NDSA towards a culture that is more inclusive, collaborative, intentional, and that has well defined metrics around recruitment and engagement.
