<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We are pleased to announce Dr. Jamie Lee as the keynote speaker for </span><a href="https://ndsa.org/conference/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Digital Preservation 2023: Communities of Time and Place (#DigiPres23)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Dr. Lee is an</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Associate Professor of Digital Culture, Information, and Society at the School of Information, University of Arizona, and is a scholar, activist, filmmaker, archivist, oral historian, partner, co-parent, neighbor, and friend. They founded and direct the Arizona Queer Archives (</span><a href="http://www.arizonaqueerarchives.com"><span style="font-weight: 400">www.arizonaqueerarchives.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">) where they train community members on facilitating oral history interviews and building collections in and with their own families and communities. With storytelling at the heart of their life&#8217;s work, Lee also directs the Digital Storytelling &amp; Oral History Lab and co-founded the Critical Archives and Curation Collaborative, the co/lab, through which they collaborate on such storytelling projects as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">secrets of the agave: a Climate Justice Storytelling Project </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><a href="http://www.secretsoftheagave.com"><span style="font-weight: 400">www.secretsoftheagave.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">the Climate Alliance Mapping Project, CAMP (</span><a href="http://www.climatealliancemap.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">www.climatealliancemap.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">), and the Stories of Arizona’s Tribal Libraries Oral History Project (with Dr. Sandy Littletree and Knowledge River). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Lee’s 2021 research monograph, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Producing the Archival Body,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> engages storytelling to re-consider how archives are defined, understood, deployed, and accessed to produce subjects. Arguing that archives and bodies are mutually constitutive and developing a keen focus on the body and embodiment alongside archival theory, Lee introduces new understandings of archival bodies that interrogate how power circulates in archival contexts in order to build critical understandings of how deeply archives shape the production of knowledges and human subjectivities.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> For more on Lee’s projects, visit </span><a href="http://www.thestorytellinglab.io"><span style="font-weight: 400">www.thestorytellinglab.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. In their keynote talk,“​​Kairotic and Kin-centric Archives: Addressing Abundances and Abandonments,” Dr. Lee traverses the persistent memories and memory-making practices of their local queer borderlands communities through frameworks of the kairotic and kin-centric. Sharing stories from two distinct community-based digital archiving projects, Lee attends to loss and to re-collection and explicitly addresses both abundances and abandonments.</span></p>
