The CC is responsible for reviewing and approving NDSA membership applications and publications; updating eligibility standards for membership in the alliance, and other strategic documents; engaging with stakeholders in the community; and working to enroll new members committed to our core mission. The successful candidates will each serve a three year term. Ballots will be sent to membership organization contacts in the coming weeks.</p>

At the Archaeology Data Service, she led a successful application for the Data Seal of Approval (now CoreTrustSeal) and was involved in the ‘Big Data Project’. From here she moved to the Borthwick Institute for Archives at the University of York where she focused on establishing policy and procedures for both digital preservation and digitisation. Here she was heavily involved in research data management, both as a facilitator in training sessions for researchers and in working on a preservation infrastructure. She led the Jisc funded project ‘Filling the Digital Preservation Gap’ which was a finalist in the Research and Innovation category of the 2016 Digital Preservation Awards. She currently holds the post of Head of Good Practice and Standards at the Digital Preservation Coalition and has been working closely with the UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority over the last two years on a digital preservation project. As part of this work, she has been involved in the development of a new maturity model for digital preservation called the Rapid Assessment Model and chairs a task force with a focus on the preservation of records from Electronic Document and Records Management Systems. She works with Coalition Members internationally to help facilitate collaboration and communication in the field of digital preservation.

She is also interested in exploring how the NDSA can align itself with the activities of other communities working toward the common goal of advancing digital stewardship practice through collaboration and knowledge exchange.</p>
