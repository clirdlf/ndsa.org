<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As of April 2020, the NDSA Leadership unanimously voted to welcome its three most recent applicants into the membership.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">University of Dayton</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Rhode Island School of Design (RISD)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">University of California, Berkeley Library</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This brings the total membership to number over 250 members! Each of these new members brings a host of skills and experience to our group. Dayton works actively to support scholarship teaching and learning; RISD has over 18TB of digital materials and has an IMLS grant to implement a new DAMS; Berkeley, led by Coordinating Committee Member, Salwa Ismail, has been solidifying its born digital workflows and is developing a web-archiving program.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each of these organizations has new additions to our various interest and working groups &#8211; so keep an eye out for them on your calls and be sure to give them a shout out. Please join me in welcoming our new members. To review our list of members, you can see them </span><a href="https://ndsa.org/membership/members/"><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
