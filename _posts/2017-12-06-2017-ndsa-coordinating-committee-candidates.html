<p>This winter, the <a href="http://ndsa.org/">National Digital Stewardship Alliance</a> turns its attention to leadership renewal. We gratefully thank our outgoing Coordinating Committee member, Jim Corridan, for his service and many contributions. And we are pleased to welcome a new co-chair for our Infrastructure Working Group, Nathan Tallman — you can learn more about NDSA leadership on the <a href="http://ndsa.org/leadership/">NDSA page</a>.</p>
<p>Members of the NDSA Coordinating Committee serve staggered three year terms.</p>
<p>Following a public call for nominations, we are presenting to members a slate of nine candidates running for the Coordinating Committee. Between now and December 20th, NDSA members will have the opportunity to affirm and endorse two candidates by vote. (One vote per member organization, with information sent via email to institutional contacts.)</p>
<p>Here are bios and statements from the candidates, presented in alphabetical order:</p>
<h3>Karen Cariani</h3>
<p>Karen Cariani is Senior Director of the WGBH Media Library and Archives (MLA) and WGBH Project Director for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB). The MLA provides licensing services and access to the WGBH collection in addition to circulation, accessioning, and preservation activities. The AAPB, a collaboration with the Library of Congress, aims to preserve and make accessible significant and historical content created by public media. Karen has been project director for numerous on-line digital projects providing preservation and access to media archive, in addition to the development of a digital media preservation system utilizing the Hydra/Samvera community open source technology in partnership with Indiana University. She is active in the archive community and professional organizations and passionate about the use of archives and library digital collections for learning and education.</p>
<p>Candidate Statement: The NDSA is a unique community dedicated to digital preservation.  This community has created amazing resources to help manage and educate people about digital preservation. The annual NDSA Digital Preservation convening provides an opportunity for people to share work related to digital preservation, and the NDSA working groups provide a platform to tackle digital preservation challenges as a community. We have common needs and concerns as stewards of digital collections. Working together we can solve some of the challenges. Raising public awareness of these challenges is critical to gaining support.  I would be honored to serve on the NDSA coordinating council to help set strategy and direction for the community.</p>
<h3>Corey Davis</h3>
<p>One of the themes that repeatedly emerged for me at the recent NDSA meetings in Pittsburgh was the need for the preservation community to work more closely with international partners, not only to mitigate against the significant risks associated with increasing political and environmental uncertainties in the U.S. and beyond, but also to build the networks and relationships that are prerequisite for doing such important work. It’s imperative that the NDSA and its members continue to strengthen their international partnerships. I bring substantive connections to the preservation community in Canada, where there are significant collaborative opportunities, and I also provide a uniquely Canadian perspective in a time when such diversity of outlook is becoming ever-more necessary.</p>
<p>I’m currently the Digital Preservation Coordinator for the Council of Prairie and Pacific University Libraries (COPPUL), which represents 22 university libraries in Western Canada. I&#8217;m also a founding member of the Canadian Association of Research Libraries’ Digital Preservation Working Group and the Portage Preservation Expert Group (PEG). Portage is a national RDM initiative, and PEG provides Portage with advice on RDM infrastructure developments supporting the long-term stewardship of research data in Canada. I’m also Coordinator of the Canadian Web Archiving Coalition (CWAC), which has over 30 members from across the GLAM sector in Canada, and I’m a member of the Canadian Research Knowledge Network&#8217;s Trusted Digital Repository Task Group. CRKN represents over 75 Canadian research libraries and undertakes large scale content acquisition and licensing. The TDRTG is developing a framework for establishing a national TDR to ensure long-term access to CRKN-licensed resources in Canada.</p>
<h3>Kate Dohe</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kate Dohe has been the Digital Programs and Initiatives Manager at the University of Maryland Libraries since 2016. In that capacity, she leads day to day operations to ensure that workflows and systems are in place to support and facilitate the creation, acquisition, discovery, and preservation of digital assets in support of the mission of the Libraries. Her department manages all digital repositories, digital preservation activities, research data services, and electronic publishing for the Libraries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Prior to joining UMD, she was the Digital Services Librarian at Georgetown University, and the digital librarian for an academic textbook publisher in California. Over the course of her career, she has created and managed digital repositories on multiple platforms with an eye to scalable, transparent, and sustainable operations in support of the research mission of the institution. One of her signature initiatives is her outreach efforts with campus student publishers, to advocate for open publishing models, digital preservation, business process management, and developing a self-supporting peer community. She earned her MLISc. from the University of Hawai&#8217;i, and also holds a BSEd. in Speech and Theater from Missouri State University. Her research interests are in digital library pedagogy, sustainable digital preservation, library publishing initiatives, student publishing, and communication frameworks for collaborative initiatives within academic libraries.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Candidate Statement: I would honored to serve on the NDSA coordinating committee and advance the national conversation about sustainable digital stewardship. I am committed to equipping digital preservation practitioners with the tools, resources, and support framework to advocate for sustainable digital preservation as a core operation of cultural heritage institutions. Whether those tools are communication toolkits and frameworks for advocacy, or decision-making tools that support cost-benefit analysis and fiscal modeling, I firmly believe that collaboration across a diverse practitioner community is essential to addressing the critical mission of preserving our cultural assets and scholarly products. </span></p>

Collaborating at the NDSA’s Coordinating Committee will afford me the privilege to interact with talented professionals and to learn the latest preservation trends. I thank you in advance for reviewing my credentials.</p>

<h3>Matt Veatch</h3>
<p>Matt Veatch is the State Archivist at the Kansas Historical Society (KSHS) in Topeka, KS, a position he has held since 2006. Collecting, preserving, and providing public access to permanently valuable Kansas government records has been his focus at the KSHS for over 25 years. Since the mid-1990’s, Veatch has been engaged in digitization, electronic records management, and digital preservation initiatives. He helped establish an electronic records management program for Kansas state government that includes active KSHS participation in IT project planning. Veatch led the Kansas Memory project, which created a scalable online delivery platform for digital collections and established digitization as a part of routine operations. He also directed a multi-year effort to plan, fund, develop, and implement the Kansas Enterprise Electronic Preservation (KEEP) system, a trusted digital repository for Kansas government records. Currently, Veatch is overseeing KEEP’s transition to Preservica Cloud Edition. Veatch served as a member of the Council of State Archivists (CoSA) Board of Directors (2012-15); CoSA President (2013-14); co-chair of CoSA’s State Electronic Records Initiative (SERI) Steering Committee (2012-15); CoSA representative to the Coalition to Advance Learning in Archives, Libraries, and Museums (2015-17); and facilitator for three, week-long, SERI-sponsored Electronic Records Institutes (2013-14) conducted for state archives staff as part of an IMLS grant project. Veatch believes the NDSA provides essential digital curation guidance, thought leadership, and collaboration opportunities that cross disciplinary boundaries. He would bring a unique and valuable government archives perspective to the NDSA Coordinating Committee.</p>
<h3>James Watson</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County with a Bachelor’s degree in History and have been employed at the Maryland State Archives since 2005 as an Appraisal and Outreach Archivist. My duties range from assisting agencies at all levels of government in Maryland in developing records retention schedules, transferring records to the Archives, managing digitization projects, developing agency policies and procedures in terms of record ingest and description, along with other varying tasks. Some of my larger scale projects that I have worked on since I began at the Maryland Archives includes, co-developing an automated electronic records processing program for our state assessment records, creating a user guide for our state-wide plats website, developing an aerial photography metadata standard for records transfers and overseeing the conservation and scanning of over 100 oversized maps that documented the early mining history of Maryland. I have recently joined the Tools and Resources subcommittee for SERI, where I hope to use my experience to add value to the work being done to assist intuitions in providing better access to their collections.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am eager to help the committee in expanding the membership and working within in the community. Over the years I’ve had opportunities to work with various members in the archiving community and have found it to be very rewarding. I would love to further expand those connections and help others who are new to the community to meet and work with their colleagues as well.</span></p>
