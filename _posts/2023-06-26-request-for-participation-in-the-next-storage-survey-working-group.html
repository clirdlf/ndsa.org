<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The latest iteration of the NDSA Storage Survey Working Group is starting up soon. This longitudinal survey has been run three times, with the last survey </span><a href="https://osf.io/uwsg7/"><span style="font-weight: 400">published in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. If you are interested in participating in this group please read the scope of work and complete <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JSkDn3VYR_Vo_97_EstK7XNR10FGjTq5tsiFLIN5CYY/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this form</a> by July 21, 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is expected that work for the survey will start in August 2023 and end about 6-10 months later, with the group meeting about twice monthly. Work would also be done between meetings to review the survey questions and results, and to write a final report. We especially welcome participation from international NDSA members and members who have not previously participated in NDSA groups.</span></p>
