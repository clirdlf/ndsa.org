<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Levels of Preservation Steering Group is pleased to announce the official release of its first round of training support materials for those who want to teach and educate others in the Levels of Preservation. This has been the product of many monthsâ€™ refinement and editing &#8211; not to mention lots of wordsmithing! Our heartfelt thanks go out to Nance McGovern (MIT) and the rest of the TAO group for their hard work on this project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The training support packet includes a comprehensive slide deck packed with information as well as a guide for users to help determine the relevant components of the slide for any style of presentation. The deck can be edited and repurposed to suit your needs or audience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Slides could be used for a full day workshop, a webinar, or just a quick infomercial like presentation. The guide helps break down which slides may be most useful for each type of presentation, however feel free to use the slides that work for your purpose or audience.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> We simply ask that you cite NDSA as the source as noted in the deck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The materials (as well as a whole host of other NDSA publications) can be found here: </span><a href="https://osf.io/je439/"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://osf.io/je439/</span></a></p>
