Committed to preserving access to our national digital heritage, we each offer our diverse skills, perspectives, experiences, cultures and orientations to achieve what we could not do alone.</p>
<p>NDSA’s <a href="http://ndsa.org/leadership/">Coordinating Committee</a> (CC) provides strategic leadership to the community in coordination with working group co-chairs. Working on the CC is an opportunity to contribute your leadership for the community as a whole while collaborating with a wonderful group of dynamic and motivated professionals. NDSA is a diverse community, working on a critical mission and we seek candidates to join the CC that bring their diverse skills, perspectives, experiences, cultures and orientations to bear on leadership initiatives.</p>
<p>The CC is dedicated to ensuring a strategic direction for NDSA, to the advancement of NDSA activities to achieve strategic goals and furthering communication. One example of collaborative work within the community to further communication is the production of the National Agenda for Digital Stewardship. The CC is responsible for reviewing and approving NDSA membership applications and publications;  updating eligibility standards for membership in the alliance, and other bylaws;engaging with stakeholders in the community; and working to enroll new members committed to our core mission. The CC commitment is for three years. NDSA has an annual membership meeting coordinated with the DLF Forum each fall. The CC meets at the annual meeting and via a monthly conference call.</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining the CC yourself, or want to nominate another member, please send the name, e-mail address, and NDSA-affiliated institution of the nominee to <a href="mailto:ndsa@diglib.org">ndsa@diglib.org</a> by November 30.  We particularly encourage and welcome nominations of people from underrepresented groups and sectors.</p>
