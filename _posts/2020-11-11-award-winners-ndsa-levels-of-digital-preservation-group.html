<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This year’s World Digital Preservation Day (</span><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%23wdpd&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=web"><span style="font-weight: 400">#WDPD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">) was the biggest yet! With outpourings of research, achievements, practical advice, and fun it was hard to believe that there were also awards as part of that process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On 05 November, the NDSA’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Levels of Digital Preservation Reboot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> was the recipient of one of the Digital Preservation Coalition’s </span><a href="https://www.dpconline.org/news/dpa2020-winners-announced"><span style="font-weight: 400">Digital Preservation Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">! We won in the ICA-sponsored category for Collaboration and Cooperation &#8211; the first time it has been awarded!  This honor is collectively bestowed on the many of you who helped craft and refine the Levels and we hope your continued ideas, and enthusiasm will keep the momentum going. Thank you for all your hard work!
