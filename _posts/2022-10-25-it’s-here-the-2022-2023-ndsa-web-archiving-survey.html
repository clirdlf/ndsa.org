<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does your organization have a web archiving program? If so, we’d love to hear more about your web archiving work! The 2022 – 2023 NDSA Web Archiving Survey aims to track the evolution of web archiving programs around the world, and help us better understand what individuals and institutions are collecting (and the kinds of infrastructure needed to help support these collecting efforts). The 2022 – 2023 Survey builds upon surveys previously conducted in 2017, 2016, 2013, and 2011 — </span><b>and though previous surveys were focused on the United States, the 2022 – 2023 version is open to our international audiences as well</b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 2022 – 2023 Survey is meant to be answered by individuals, and there is no limit on the number of individual responses per organization. You (and your organization) do not need to be a member of the National Digital Stewardship Alliance to answer this survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Follow this link to access the survey: </span><a href="https://forms.gle/axWqYoP5ziYix3RP7"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://forms.gle/axWqYoP5ziYix3RP7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. It will remain open until </span><b>Friday, November 4, 2022 </b><span style="font-weight: 400">and should take no more than fifteen minutes to complete. We will make our best effort to protect your individual responses so that no one will be able to connect your responses with you or your organization. Any personal information that could identify you or your organization will be removed or changed before survey results are made public. We will combine your responses along with the responses of others and make the aggregated results public in early 2023.</span></p>
