<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We can’t believe it’s been almost 9 months since Version 2 of the Levels of Preservation was released at DigiPres 2019! As we continue to move forward with other resources that build on the revised Levels, we wanted to hear from you about how the revisions and associated documents like the Implementation Guidelines and Assessment Tool have worked for you over these past 9 months.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you have used the revised Levels or associated materials, we would love to know how you used them and how they were useful to you and your organization! Please send us an email at </span><a href="mailto:ndsa-digipres@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight: 400">ndsa-digipres@gmail.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> or fill out this </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNYi1k1qmPcAbbDsSQdZ33pWRjojUP6mWJvEZhZzl6K75ilA/viewform?usp=sf_link"><span style="font-weight: 400">form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.  Responses are requested by July 31, 2020.  </span></p>
