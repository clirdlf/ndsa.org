<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Digital Preservation (DigiPres) is the NDSA’s annual conference &#8211; open to members and non-members alike &#8211; focused on stewardship, curation, and preservation of digital information and cultural heritage. </span><b>The 2021 meeting will take place on November 10-11th 2021 in St. Louis, Missouri, just after the DLF Forum.</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">NDSA is an affiliate of the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) and the Digital Library Federation (DLF), and the DigiPres conference is held in concert with the annual DLF Forum. CLIR continues to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and after successfully pivoting to a virtual format for 2020, will be making a call on this for 2021 by early spring 2021. </span></p>
