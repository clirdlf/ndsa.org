<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The NDSA Excellence Awards Working Group (EAWG) </span><b>seeks new co-chairs and at-large members! </b><span style="font-weight: 400">This group relies on volunteer participation from the digital preservation community to publicize the nomination process, review nominations, select the winners, and work closely with the awardees and the </span><a href="https://ndsa.org/conference/"><span style="font-weight: 400">DigiPres</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> conference program committee to organize the Awards Ceremony. The group typically meets once a month and works as needed in between regularly scheduled calls to support the awards process. Most work outside of meetings occurs when reviewing applications (2-4 hours), and then in October leading up to the Awards Ceremony (1-2 hours/week). We welcome participation from students and early career professionals, as well as from those who have been in the digital preservation field for a while!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The</span><a href="https://ndsa.org/groups/excellence-awards/"><span style="font-weight: 400"> NDSA Excellence Awards</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400">were established in 2012 to highlight and commend all forms of creative and meaningful contributions by individual professionals, future stewards, educators, organizations, projects, and sustainability activities to the field of digital preservation. They offer a wonderful opportunity to learn about the activities and impact of a wide range of exceptional people and projects. Recently, a cooperative agreement was reached with the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) allowing the awards programs for both groups to be presented on an interleaved biennial basis. The NDSA Awards are presented in the odd-numbered years (including this year at </span><a href="https://ndsa.org/conference/"><span style="font-weight: 400">DigiPres 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">in St. Louis on November 15-16, 2023!), while the DPC program takes place in even-numbered years. This provides an opportunity to work with digital preservationists from around the world as a judge on the DPC Digital Preservation Awards in 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Please consider contributing important professional service back to the digital stewardship community.  If you would like to join the EAWG, please fill out this </span><a href="https://forms.gle/PhPM7DtcNn1YvDPL6"><span style="font-weight: 400">form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400">provide a brief statement of interest.
