<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Proposals have been accepted by the NDSA Coordinating Committee for starting up the Staffing Survey Working Group and the Fixity Survey Working Group. Both surveys were last published in 2017. If you are interested in participating in either of these groups please read the scope of work for each and complete the form below by April 2, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is expected that work for both surveys would start Spring 2021 and end about a year/year and a half later, with groups generally meeting on a monthly basis. Work would also be done between meetings to review the survey questions and results, and to write a final report. We especially welcome participation from international NDSA members and members who have not previously participated in NDSA groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>Fixity Survey Scope of Work</em>: Review of survey, survey deployment, data analysis, writing final report</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>Staffing Survey Scope of Work</em>: Survey redesign, survey deployment, data analysis, research, writing final report</span></p>
