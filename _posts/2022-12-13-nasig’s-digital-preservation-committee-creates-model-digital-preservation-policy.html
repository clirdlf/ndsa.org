<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">This guest post is from Steve Oberg, Social Media Coordinator at NASIG and Acquisitions and Discovery Services Group Manager at Wheaton College’s Buswell Library.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In June of this year, NASIG’s </span><a href="https://www.nasig.org/Digital-Preservation-Committee"><span style="font-weight: 400">Digital Preservation Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> announced publication of the </span><a href="https://www.nasig.org/NASIG-model-digital-preservation-policy/#Top"><span style="font-weight: 400">NASIG Model Digital Preservation Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, an important new tool designed to help measure, grow, and publicize your organization’s commitment to preserving its scholarship. It includes advice on identifying and taking first steps, as well as more advanced options and activities, and provides opportunities to share and refine professional experiences. Developed in informal collaboration with the </span><a href="https://librarypublishing.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Library Publishing Coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><a href="https://www.sspnet.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Society for Scholarly Publishing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the model policy is licensed under a</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> with hopes for wide use or reuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is a fantastic resource for any organization or institution that wishes to preserve the valuable digital content in its collections and a great example of collaboration between NASIG and its colleagues within the wider information community” said Ted Westervelt, Past President of NASIG.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jennifer Regala from the American Urological Association said, “Developing a preservation policy is so important for publishers of all kinds. This model policy is the first of its kind. Written with publishers in mind, it is a valuable, accessible tool developed by library preservation experts and library/society/university presses. I applaud NASIG’s leadership in bringing diverse stakeholders together to collaborate in this fruitful way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Release of the model policy has generated tremendous interest and stimulated organizations to progress in developing their own policies. The new model policy was featured in well attended sessions at The Charleston Conference in November, as well as at NISO Plus 2022. At the Charleston Conference session, for example, </span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/edinburgh-diamond"><span style="font-weight: 400">Edinburgh Diamond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> told attendees how they developed their own policy drawing inspiration from NASIG’s model policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">NASIG has a strong history of developing resources for the benefit of the broader community. The NASIG Model Digital Preservation Policy complements other publications including its well-regarded </span><a href="https://www.nasig.org/Competencies-Scholarly-Communication"><span style="font-weight: 400">Core Competencies for Scholarly Communication Librarians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://www.nasig.org/Competencies-Eresources"><span style="font-weight: 400">Core Competencies for Electronic Resources Librarians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span><a href="https://www.nasig.org/Competencies-Print"><span style="font-weight: 400">Core Competencies for Print Serials Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://nasig.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">NASIG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is an independent, non-profit organization working to advance and transform the management of information resources. Our ultimate goal is to facilitate and improve the distribution, acquisition, and long-term accessibility of information resources in all formats and business models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We hope that members of the NDSA community will also find this useful. Questions about the policy can be emailed to info@nasig.org.</span></p>
