<p><em>Digital Preservation</em> is the NDSA’s major meeting and conference—open to members and non-members alike—focusing on digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, and related issues. This year, it will be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 25-26, 2017 after the <a href="https://www.diglib.org/forums/2017forum/">DLF Forum</a>.</p>
<p>Logistical arrangements will be handled by the Digital Library Federation, so that this committee can focus more fully on the program for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=%23digipres17&amp;src=typd">#digipres17</a>. Duties involve defining the vision for the event, drafting and circulating a CFP, coordinating the review and selection of proposals, crafting and publicizing the schedule, and collaborating with the DLF Forum planning committee to make this conference partnership a success. We anticipate monthly group calls and regular email exchanges April-October.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to help shape a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field of digital preservation—as well as to set the tone and direction for future NDSA events. Join us!</p>
<p>Volunteers from <a href="http://ndsa.diglib.org/members-list/">NDSA member organizations</a> are asked to <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/1EfT8jrK9fDa8H0u2"><strong>complete this form</strong></a><strong> by Monday, March 6th</strong>.</p>
