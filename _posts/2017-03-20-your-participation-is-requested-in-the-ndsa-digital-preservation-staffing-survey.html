<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Curious about how other institutions staff their digital repositories? Or, how they hope to align staff responsibilities as they grow? Members of the <a href="http://ndsa.org">National Digital Stewardship Alliance</a> have formed the Staffing Survey Working Group to survey repositories internationally for insights into these questions.  Our survey will explore how organizations worldwide are addressing digital preservation staffing, scoping and structural questions. The results of this survey will build on the knowledge gained through a similar 2012 survey which were published in the</span><a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2013/12/just-released-staffing-for-effective-digital-preservation-an-ndsa-report/"> <span style="font-weight: 400">2013 NDSA Report: Staffing for Effective Digital Preservation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. A new report will analyze the new data as its own information as well as in comparison with the 2013 report.</span></p>
