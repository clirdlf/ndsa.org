<p>The proposals are in for the <a href="https://forum2018.diglib.org/">DLF Forum</a>, <a href="https://forum2018.diglib.org/learnatdlf/">Learn@DLF</a>, and NDSA’s <a href="http://ndsa.org/meetings/">Digital Preservation 2018</a>! Now it’s time to shape the program. <strong>From May 9 &#8211; May 21, proposals will be open for public voting</strong> through the DLF community voting app: <strong><a href="http://voting.diglib.org/">voting.diglib.org</a></strong>.</p>
<p>During this period, community members will be able to review titles and the short versions of abstracts, and cast votes based on their interest in seeing certain presentations as part of the DLF Forum, Learn@DLF, and NDSA’s DigiPres18. After voting closes, the program planning committees for each event will use the community’s input, <strong><em>in combination with results from a concurrent peer review process</em></strong>, to inform its decisions about the conference programs.</p>
<p>People who submitted complete proposals will be notified of status in the summer. Presenters will be guaranteed a registration place at the Forum.</p>

<h3>Voting Process</h3>
<p>Anyone is welcome to vote. You will need to a create an account on <strong><a href="http://voting.diglib.org/">voting.diglib.org</a></strong>. You can cast votes for as many presentations as you’d like, but only one vote per presentation. For each presentation, the proposal type is listed to the right of the “Cast Vote” button.</p>
<p>The title and abstract will be available for each proposal. You can toggle between the three events using the top menu in blue.</p>
<p>Voting closes at <strong>11:59 pm PT</strong> on <strong>Monday, May 21</strong>.</p>
<p>The planning committees for the three events will consider community voting results among other factors, including the peer review results, when making final decisions on the 2018 programs.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping to inform our selection process!</p>
