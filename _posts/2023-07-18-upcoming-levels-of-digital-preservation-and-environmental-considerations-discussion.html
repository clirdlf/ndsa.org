<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Please join the NDSA Levels Steering Group on <strong>August 16th</strong> for an open discussion about the <strong>intersection of the NDSA Levels and environmental concerns.</strong> Wildfires in Canada and excessive heat across the globe this summer make the impact of climate change impossible to ignore. As stewards of digital content, how do we balance our obligations to long-term preservation of digital cultural heritage and the sustainability of our planet? A planet we need in order to bother with digital preservation at all. The NDSA Levels themselves have been the subject of critique by practitioners with environmental sustainability in mind &#8211; citing the perception that level 4 is the goal, for example, rather than an option. We want to hear from you, and open a discussion about the role of the NDSA Levels of Preservation in a rapidly changing world. </span></p>
<p>Call in information is available on the meeting notes <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kKI_NlTlnAUg5H9y_evyRLGyiudddJRZEE1in5eeC7Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document</a>.  We hope to see you on <span style="font-weight: 400">Wednesday, August 16, 2023 at </span><span style="font-weight: 400">11:30 a.m. EDT.</span></p>
