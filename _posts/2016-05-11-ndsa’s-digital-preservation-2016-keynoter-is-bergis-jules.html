His previous work with community archives and African American collections include leading projects at the Black Metropolis Research Consortium at the University of Chicago, and designing and securing grant funding for the D.C. Africana Archives Project at George Washington University. Bergis helps lead the Inland Empire Memories consortium at the University of California, Riverside library, which is a community owned consortium of cultural heritage organizations, with the goal of uncovering and sharing the extremely diverse history of inland Southern California. He is a co-director on a 2016 IMLS funded National Forum grant to host a series of meetings across the country that will explore strategies and tools for integrating community archives in the National Digital Platform. In addition to his community archives work, Bergis is interested in the rich potential that social media and web archives hold for contributing to more diverse library research collections by helping to counter existing silences in our historical records, through inclusion of more voices from traditionally marginalized communities. He is one of the principal investigators on a 2015 funded project for social media archiving from the Andrew Mellon Foundation titled, Documenting the Now: Supporting Scholarly Use and Preservation of Social Media Content. The goal of the project is to build an open source and cloud ready tool, that will capture tweets and their associated metadata and digital content for long term preservation by archivists and analysis by researchers and others. Bergis received an M.L.S. with a Specialization in Archives and Records Management and an M.A. in African American and African Diaspora Studies from Indiana University in 2009. Beginning in September 2016, he will be doctoral student in the History Department at the University of California, Riverside. <em>Find him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BergisJules">@BergisJules</a>.</em></span></p>
