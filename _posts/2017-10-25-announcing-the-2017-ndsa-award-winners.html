<h3>Organization Award</h3>
<div class="row">
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-14706 alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.diglib.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/dpn2-e1508356744347-300x160.jpg?resize=300%2C160&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="160" data-recalc-dims="1" />The <a href="https://dpn.org/"><strong>Digital Preservation Network </strong></a>(DPN) is a membership organization focused on developing solutions to meet the challenges of long-term preservation of academic and cultural heritage digital assets. The large-scale digital preservation services developed by DPN are built to last beyond the life spans of individuals, technological systems, and organizations. DPN provides members of the academy and their successors with assurance that future access to their scholarly resources will be available in the event of disruptive change in administrative or physical institutional environments. By working together, DPN members are collaboratively solving issues that have been difficult to achieve separately.Beyond DPN&#8217;s core mission of ensuring the secure preservation of stored content by leveraging a heterogeneous network that spans diverse geographic, technical, and institutional environments, the organization is recognized for its creation, with partner AVPreserve, of its Digital Preservation Workflow Curriculum.  The curriculum/workshop series provides a bridge between the desire to participate in digital preservation projects and the capacity to connect local content and resources to that aim, providing a flexible framework for guiding an organization through the necessary decision making processes for establishing a sustainable digital preservation workflow. Mary Molinaro, Chief Operating Officer &#038; Service Manager, will accept this award on behalf of DPN.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-14707 alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.diglib.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/ePADD-team-w-partners4-300x278.jpg?resize=300%2C278&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="278" data-recalc-dims="1" />The <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd"><strong>ePadd</strong></a> project is an undertaking to develop free and open-source computational analysis software that facilitates screening, browsing, and access for historically and culturally significant email collections. The software incorporates techniques from computer science and computational linguistics, including natural language processing, named entity recognition, and other statistical machine-learning associated processes.ePADD Phase 1 was developed from 2013-2015 by staff of the Department of Special Collections and University Archives, Stanford University Libraries (SUL), Stanford University.  The software was developed with grant funding provided through the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC). Additional funding was provided through SUL’s Payson J. Treat Fund for Library Program Development and Research.</p>
<p>ePADD Phase 2 is being developed from 2015-2018 by staff of the Department of Special Collections and University Archives, Stanford University Libraries (SUL), Stanford University, in collaboration with partners at Harvard University, the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and University of California, Irvine.  Funding for ePADD Phase 2 is provided through an Institute of Museum &#038; Library Studies (IMLS) National Leadership Grant (NLG) for Libraries, which supports projects that address challenges faced by the library and archive fields and that have the potential to advance practice in those fields.</p>
<p>The ePadd project is recognized for developing an effective, useful, accessible tool that has significantly lowered technical and other resource barriers to appraising, acquiring, processing, and making accessible large email collections for individuals and museums, archives, and libraries, both large and small.  It has served as well, as an effective demonstration of the concrete possibilities of working with born-digital textual collections.  The project team have also been noted for fostering open collaboration, community-building, and support. <strong>Glynn Edwards</strong>, Assistant Director, Department of Special Collections at SUL, and Project Director, will accept this award on behalf of the project.</p>
