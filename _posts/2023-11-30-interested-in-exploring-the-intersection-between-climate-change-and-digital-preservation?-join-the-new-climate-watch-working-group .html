<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Global warming and climate change is currently wreaking havoc on the world. As digital preservation professionals, it is our responsibility to mitigate threats that impede our ability to steward digital materials through time. Climate change not only threatens our data through more frequent and more severe weather disasters, but also through reductions in food supply, mass migrations, economic contraction, and political upheaval. In order to start addressing these very real threats, the Climate Watch Working Group has been charged with:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Producing regular annotated bibliographies on recent literature, news, and reports related to climate change and its impact on digital preservation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Creating and adding to an ongoing list of potential risks climate change poses to digital preservation work</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Creating and adding to lists of core climate change information resources to get a solid grounding in the issue, help with future projections, and lobby for preservation resources.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Climate Watch Working Group is the first of at least two NDSA working groups that will be formed to help the profession address how we can adapt our practices and policies to the uncertain future climate change poses. Both groups are expected to work closely together and members who sign up for the Climate Watch Working Group will be welcome to move to the Climate Preparation group when it is established. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The <a href="https://ndsa.org/groups/climate-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate Watch Working Group</a> will meet twice a month with regular assignments between meetings. The expected time commitment is approximately 30 minutes to one hour a week in addition to the bimonthly meeting time.      </span></p>
