<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In July of this year, Ithaka S+R researchers published a long-awaited </span><a href="https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-246365-ols-20"><span style="font-weight: 400">IMLS funded</span></a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.18665/sr.316990"><span style="font-weight: 400">report on digital preservation and curation systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This report has generated much discussion and some controversy within the digital preservation community</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. NDSA sees and appreciates practitionersâ€™ hard work in preserving our collective cultural heritage, work that is apparent not only in community discussions but was also recently studied in the </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/UWSG7"><span style="font-weight: 400">2019 Storage Infrastructure Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/EMWY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">2021 Staffing Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">NDSA would like to host an open conversation for the community to discuss this report and its impact. This will take two forms: an </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mOFSJEG2pJKhLfovSJPSvpCJigbi4btY7EwWgyom8Yk/edit?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400">open Google Doc for asynchronous participation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and an online meeting. Both of these venues will be governed by the </span><a href="https://ndsa.org/about/code-of-conduct/"><span style="font-weight: 400">NDSA Code of Conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. The Google Doc will be open from the publication time of this blog post until the online meeting, which will use a similar structure. The </span><a href="https://psu.zoom.us/j/94517921835"><span style="font-weight: 400">open session will take place over Zoom on October 26, 12:30-1:30pm Eastern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the passcode is the acronym of our organization.</span></p>
