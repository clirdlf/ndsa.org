<p>These awards focus on recognizing excellence in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals</strong> making a significant, innovative contribution to the digital preservation community.</li>
<li><strong>Projects</strong> whose goals or outcomes represent an inventive, meaningful addition to the understanding or processes required for successful, sustainable digital preservation stewardship.</li>
<li><strong>Organizations</strong> taking an innovative approach to providing support and guidance to the digital preservation community.</li>
<li><strong>Future stewards</strong>, especially students, taking a creative approach to advancing knowledge of digital preservation issues and practices.</li>
<li><strong>Educators</strong>, including trainers or curricular endeavors, promoting innovative approaches and access to digital preservation through partnerships, professional development opportunities, and curriculum.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a diverse membership group with a shared commitment to digital preservation, the NDSA understands the importance of innovation and risk-taking in developing and supporting a broad range of successful digital preservation activities.  Acknowledging that innovative digital stewardship can take many forms, eligibility for these awards has been left purposely broad. Nominations are open to anyone or anything that falls into the above categories and any entity can be nominated for one of the four awards. Nominees should be US-based people and projects or collaborative international projects that contain a US-based partner. This is your chance to help us highlight and reward novel, risk-taking, and inventive approaches to the challenges of digital preservation.</p>
<p>You can submit a nomination via this quick, easy online submission form: <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/VK63BN5">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/VK63BN5</a>.</p>
