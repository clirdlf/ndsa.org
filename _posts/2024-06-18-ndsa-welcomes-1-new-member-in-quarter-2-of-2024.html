<p><b>The Gates Preserve</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On their <a href="https://www.thegatespreserve.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>, The Gates Preserve, “believes that archiving is a statement of value. Taking the time to gather, contextualize, catalog, and articulate the moments of an individual, a culture, or a subculture is critical to its legacy persisting into the future. We believe in thoughtful, carefully constructed legacies that are presented and shared in a way that honors its subjects. This is what we’ve attempted to do here.”  In their application, The Gates Preserve states that they would &#8220;like to be in alignment with associations that are doing work in alignment with the services they offer their clients&#8221; and the activities and commitments in digital preservation. </span></p>
