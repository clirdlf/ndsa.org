<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Starting this month, February 2022, the NDSA Interest Groups will be moving to a rotating quarterly call schedule. This will help members who have wanted to participate in multiple Interest groups but didn’t have the time for two or more calls a month. It will also give Interest Group Co-Chairs more time and flexibility to plan these calls, while also creating opportunities for more cross-group pollination activities, such as quarterly themes and cross-group networking calls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each Interest Group will meet once every three months, on the following schedule:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">January 10: Standards &amp; Practices</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">February 2: Content</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">March 21: Infrastructure</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">April 11: Standards &amp; Practices</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">May 4: Content</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">June 20: Infrastructure</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">July 11: Standards &amp; Practices</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">August 3: Content</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">September 19: Infrastructure</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">October 10: Standards &amp; Practices</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">November 5: Content</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">December 19: Infrastructure</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The updated schedule is reflected on the </span><a href="https://ndsa.org/about/calendar/"><span style="font-weight: 400">NDSA Calendar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a reminder, NDSA now has a Slack Workspace. Each Interest Group has a channel if you would like to continue conversations between Interest Group meetings. Join one, or join them all. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Our workspace address </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and join link is available on each of the Interest Group meeting note documents.  </span></p>
