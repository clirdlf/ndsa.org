<p>It’s hard to believe, but <strong>CFP season is here</strong>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a great idea for a session to share at one of our events in Tampa? You’re in luck! We have just issued Calls for Proposals for our conferences happening this October: the <a href="https://forum2019.diglib.org/">DLF Forum</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dlfforum">#DLFforum</a>, October 14-16), our <a href="https://forum2019.diglib.org/learnatdlf/">Learn@DLF</a> pre-conference  (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/learnatdlf">#learnatdlf</a>, October 13), and NDSA’s <a href="https://ndsa.org/meetings/">Digital Preservation 2019: Critical Junctures</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/digipres19">#digipres19</a>, October 16-17).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For all events, we welcome submissions from members and nonmembers alike. Students, practitioners, and others from any related field are invited to submit for one conference or all three (though, different proposals for each, please).</p>
