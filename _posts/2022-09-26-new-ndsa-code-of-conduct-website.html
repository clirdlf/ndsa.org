<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A Code of Conduct <a href="https://ndsa.org/about/code-of-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webpage</a> is now available sharing information on NDSA’s Code of Conduct practices.  The website links to the Code of Conduct itself, but also provides information on how to report code of conduct violations.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In most NDSA online spaces, the quickest way to report any concerns or violations is to complete an anonymous <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewTqT0tkn6e-ar3ljM1pmbef7uvJ4Ryf64q-XfkFiVuhKxDg/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">form</a>.  Other options include reaching out to Chairs of groups or someone in the <a href="https://ndsa.org/about/leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leadership group</a>.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to this information being available on the website, it is also available at the top of all the Interest Group meeting notes as well as being a pinned post on all Slack channels.  </span></p>
