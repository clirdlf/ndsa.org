<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) announced the finalists for the Digital Preservation Awards 2020 in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dpconline.org/news/dpa2020-finalists-announced-cc/">International Council on Archives Collaboration and Cooperation</a> category. We are pleased to announce that the collaboration around the revision work for the NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation is a finalist!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The revision and enhancement of the NDSA Levels of Preservation took a great deal of time and energy from many, many people. Due to the time boundaries of the award, the focus of the Levels Revision project was on three of the five working subgroups of the project which included the active participation of 43 people from four different countries (Canada, Turkey, the UK, and the US). This hard work resulted in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://osf.io/2mkwx/">revised Levels Matrix</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://osf.io/vnc32/">an Implementation Guide</a>, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://osf.io/m2fek/">Assessment Tool</a>.  “This continues to be a major effort that has pulled in expertise from within and beyond the NDSA to provide clear guidance to anyone who seeks to preserve digital content,” says Bradley Daigle who chairs the overall Levels effort.</span></p>
