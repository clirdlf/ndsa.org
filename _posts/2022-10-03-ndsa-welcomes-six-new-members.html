The university library is therefore still developing and is interested in participating in any endeavor that ensures that digital information of continuing value remains accessible and usable to its users. As a growing library that has to make do with a shrinking budget, digital preservation is very important to them in ensuring that whatever valuable information they have is preserved for continued access and use. The library has started a project called &#8220;Presidential collection @BIUST&#8221; that seeks to preserve the legacy of the sitting and former presidents of Botswana through digitization of such content.</span></p>
