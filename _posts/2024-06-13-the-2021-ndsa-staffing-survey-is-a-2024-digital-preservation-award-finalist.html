<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) has recently announced the finalists for the 2024 Digital Preservation Awards. We are very pleased to announce that the Working Group team behind the revision and reimagining of the 2021 NDSA Staffing Survey are </span><a href="https://www.dpconline.org/events/digital-preservation-awards/the-finalists-collaboration-and-cooperation"><span style="font-weight: 400">finalists for the International Council on Archives Award for Collaboration &amp; Cooperation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The redesign of the </span><a href="https://osf.io/2rb7k"><span style="font-weight: 400">2021 NDSA Staffing Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> was a significant international effort to build and refine one of the only longitudinal open datasets of its kind by reconfiguring the survey from an organizational focus (as seen in the </span><a href="https://ndsa.org/documents/NDSA-Staffing-Survey-Report-Final122013.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">2012</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://osf.io/mbcxt"><span style="font-weight: 400">2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> versions), to allow for individual participation. This shift allowed for a more detailed picture of the current state of digital preservation staffing to emerge from the data, and was the product of intensive collaboration between the members of the Working Group, as well as the digital preservation community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">DPC members will be selecting their first and second choices for each category as well as providing feedback on the finalists to the judges before winners are selected. Voting opens on this Friday, June 14 and closes on Friday, July 12, 2024. </span><b>(If you are a DPC member, we would really appreciate your vote!)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Winners will be announced at iPres 2024 in Ghent, Belgium on Monday, September 16.</span></p>
