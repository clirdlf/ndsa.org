<p>Dear NDSA Community,<br class="" /><br class="" />As members of the National Digital Stewardship Alliance we join together to form a consortium of over 236 partnering organizations, including universities, professional associations, businesses, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations, all engaged in the long-term preservation of digital information. Committed to preserving access to our national digital heritage, we each offer our diverse skills, perspectives, experiences, cultures and orientations to achieve what we could not do alone.<br class="" /><br class="" />NDSA’s Coordinating Committee (CC) provides strategic leadership to the organization in coordination with working group co-chairs. NDSA is a diverse community with a critical mission, and we seek candidates to join the CC that bring a variety of skills, perspectives, experiences, cultures and orientations to bear on leadership initiatives. Working on the CC is an opportunity to contribute your leadership for the community as a whole while collaborating with a wonderful group of dynamic and motivated professionals.<br class="" /><br class="" />The CC is dedicated to ensuring a strategic direction for NDSA, to the advancement of NDSA activities to achieve community goals, and to further communication among digital preservation professionals and NDSA member organizations. The CC is responsible for reviewing and approving NDSA membership applications and publications; updating eligibility standards for membership in the alliance, and other bylaws; producing the National Agenda for Digital Stewardship, engaging with stakeholders in the community; and working to enroll new members committed to our core mission. NDSA has an annual membership meeting co-located with the Digital Library Federation Forum each fall. Elected CC members serve a three year term, participate in a monthly call, and meet face to face at the annual membership meeting (Digipres). <br class="" /><br class="" />If you are interested in joining the CC or want to nominate another member, please send the name, e-mail address, brief (nominee-approved) bio/candidate statement, and NDSA-affiliated institution of the nominee to <a class="" href="mailto:ndsa@diglib.org">ndsa@diglib.org</a> by Nov 14, 2018 <strong>[update: the nominations deadline has been extended to Nov 25!].</strong>  We particularly encourage and welcome nominations of people from underrepresented groups and sectors.<br class="" /><br class="" />We hope you will give this opportunity serious consideration and we value your continued contributions and leadership in our community.<br class="" /><br class="" />Very Best,<br class="" /><br class="" />Robin Ruggaber &amp;  Bethany Nowviskie<br class="" /><br class="" />On behalf of the NDSA Coordinating Committee</p>
