<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you work at an organization that stewards digital content for long-term preservation? If so, we’d like to hear from you about staffing for digital preservation at your organization. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The 2021 NDSA Staffing Survey is designed to gain insight into current and ideal staffing for digital preservation programs. </span></p>
<p><b>The 2021 Staffing Survey is meant to be answered by individuals and there is no limit on the number of individual respondents per organization</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Responses are sought from individuals worldwide with current digital preservation responsibilities at their organization, ranging from practitioners to department managers to senior leadership. </span><b>You do not need to be an NDSA member to answer this survey.</b></p>
<p><a href="https://virginia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bNNlS4uDFyZYF8i"><b>Follow this link to access the survey</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. It is available until </span><b>Friday, December 10, 2021</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and is expected to take approximately</span><b> 20-25</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> minutes to complete. To assist with completing the survey, a PDF preview of all of the survey questions can be viewed in advance by </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_9qXfWeKXvq7dG_2iPfhkRk30DgSt4P9/view"><span style="font-weight: 400">following this link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><b>The 2021 survey has undergone an extensive redesign</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the earlier 2012 and 2017 iterations, prompted by findings from the last survey and changes in the field over the last decade. During this process, the Staffing Survey Working Group aimed to ensure that all participants would see themselves reflected in the answer choices. While the survey is not exhaustive, we believe it strikes a balance. However, we welcome all feedback about how future instances of the survey can be improved, and encourage participants to submit their comments at the survey’s end.</span></p>
