<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This year we have four people who have thrown their hats into the ring to run for the NDSA’s Coordinating Committee (CC), of which we will elect three. The CC is dedicated to ensuring a strategic direction for NDSA, to the advancement of NDSA activities to achieve community goals, and to further communication among digital preservation professionals and NDSA member organizations. The CC is responsible for reviewing and approving NDSA membership applications and publications; updating eligibility standards for membership in the alliance, and other strategic documents; engaging with stakeholders in the community; and working to enroll new members committed to our core mission. The successful candidates will each serve a three year term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each member organization will receive an email invitation to the ballot in the coming weeks. But right now let’s meet the candidates!</span></p>

She previously was the Digital Archivist and a National Digital Stewardship Resident at Johns Hopkins University. Elizabeth currently serves on the NDSA Communications and Publications group and the DigiPres 2020 Planning Committee. As a past recipient of the NDSA Future Steward award, Elizabeth is interested in advancing NDSA as a resource and community for students and early-career digital stewards, and strengthening the Alliance by increasing representation and inclusion of smaller institutions and colleagues from groups marginalized in the field. Elizabeth is interested in joining the Coordinating Committee to help further realize this work as well as priorities identified in the 2020 Agenda, particularly around the value of digital preservation labor and exploring sustainability models for digital stewardship educational and training programs.</p>
