<p>The NDSA Levels Steering Team is excited to announce the introduction of bi-monthly open <span class="il">office</span> <span class="il">hours</span>. In these informal sessions, we will welcome all members of the digital preservation community to chat about the NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation and ask questions about their use and how to move forward. The sessions will also be used to gather community input on the future direction of the Levels and &#8220;next steps&#8221;.   To begin, each session will include an open discussion and a focused topic discussion. We are also crafting a list of future topics that anyone can contribute to for future meeting discussion topics.</p>
<p>The first open office hour will be on the 20 April (1130 EST). The focused discussion for our first session will be the topic of Documentation and the Levels. Have you ever wondered how to document that you are giving “Level 3” care to a collection, for a donor, senior manager, or other stakeholder? Do you want to demonstrate that your solution is capable of providing a certain Level of Preservation, depending on its implementation? Do you think that documentation is worthwhile &#8211; or not worthwhile &#8211; and want to discuss the “whys”? Then this open <span class="il">office</span> <span class="il">hour</span> is for you!  The second part of the meeting will be open questions and discussion.</p>
<p>Come join us!</p>
<p>(Meeting connection details will be shared soon in an NDSA-All email. Questions contact ndsa.digipres [at] gmail [dot] com)</p>
