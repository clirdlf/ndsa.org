<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Based on the overwhelming responses to our community </span><a href="https://forms.gle/bPTHJggJpnMPYWoe6"><span style="font-weight: 400">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the number and distribution of proposals for all CFPs, and CLIR’s ongoing monitoring of the pandemic situation, it has become clear to us that for the health and safety of our attendees and presenters, </span><b>we must transition all of our fall events to a virtual format</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. We are sorry we won’t be able to explore Baltimore in 2020, but we’re already making arrangements to hold our 2022 events there, so we’ll just have to wait a bit longer to enjoy time together in Charm City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What does this mean for 2020? We are not entirely sure yet, but we would love your input. We are happy to share </span><a href="https://forms.gle/EJ7vNi2zci2VtDda8"><span style="font-weight: 400">this second community survey about virtual events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in which we ask for your thoughts on what you’d like to see from a virtual CLIR/DLF event or series of events this fall. We would appreciate your input by Monday, June 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We understand that you may have questions, and while we may not have the answers just yet, we welcome the dialogue with you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at </span><a href="mailto:forum@diglib.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">forum@diglib.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and thank you so much for your understanding and patience during this unprecedented time. Stay healthy and safe, and we’ll be in touch with more soon.</span></p>
