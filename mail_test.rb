Dear #{parse_name(primary_contact)},

This summer the National Digital Stewardship Alliance turns its attention to leadership renewal. We gratefully thank our outgoing working group chairs and Coordinating Committee members for their service across the transition period to our new home at the Digital Library Federation.

Members of the NDSA Coordinating Committee serve staggered three year terms and five members will have completed their terms, retiring as of the Fall meeting. We thank Jonathan Crabtree, Meg Phillips, John Spencer, Helen Tibbo, and Kate Wittenberg for their many contributions.

Following a public call for nominations, we are presenting a slate of five candidates to join the Coordinating Committee, and ask that you affirm and endorse them by vote.

* Bradley Daigle, Partnerships/Content Lead, APTrust
* Carol Kussman, Digital Preservation Analyst, U of Minnesota Libraries
* Mary Molinaro, Chief Operating Officer &amp; Services Manager, DPN
* Gabby Redwine, Digital Archivist at Yale
* Helen Tibbo, Alumni Distinguished Professor, SLIS, UNC-Chapel Hill

Your organization can cast its vote at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BQQQ6RJ between August 1 and August 15. Vote for any or all candidates you would like to see as CC members. Candidate statements can be found at https://www.diglib.org/?p=12333.

As a reminder, only one ballot may be cast per member organization. NDSA's recorded program representative or a designated proxy of each member organization is asked to submit your organization's vote.

Thank you for your participation,

The NDSA Coordinating Committee
