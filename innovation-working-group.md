By encouraging and sharing innovative methods of digital preservation practices and technologies, the Innovation Interest Group distributes, documents, and shares emerging concepts, while conducting and guiding research and development with engaged partners to explore new solutions and opportunities.

This group administers the NDSA's Annual [Innovation Awards](/awards/). Nominations are open until 8/1 for the 2016 NDSA Innovation Awards; [make a nomination](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ndsa2016innovationawards)!

The Innovation Interest Group is currently engaged in two projects:

- Developing a series of digital preservation challenges to recognize and encourage important innovative work in digital preservation.
- Hosting a series of dialogs with individuals with a range of viewpoints or organizations and specialties outside NDSA, to bring a creative mix of ideas and experience into the conversation with the digital preservation community.
