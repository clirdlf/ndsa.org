**The Innovation Interest Group is no longer active.**

The Innovation Interest Group has a more than six-year history of activity under the umbrella of NDSA. Among its initiatives are:
- The [NDSA Innovation Awards](/awards)
- Insights Interviews and Digital Pioneers Series, posted on the Library of Congress digital preservation blog, [The Signal](http://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/)
- [Digital Preservation Stack Exchange](http://qanda.digipres.org/) (in partnership with OPF)
- [Digital Stewardship Innovation IDEAS (DSII) Challenge](http://dsii.ideascale.com/) for 2014
- "Neighborhood Watch" for Repository Quality Assurance
- Google Summer of Code project
- SWAT sites (in NY) for the long tail of digital media
- Short papers on web archiving and disaster planning

During the summer of 2016, members of the Innovation Interest Group began a review of the Interest Group’s six-year history, and a reflection on whether or not there was a vision for the continuing activity of this group, and, more importantly, if there people whose interests aligned with that vision, and would undertake the work of the group as currently defined.

It was decided to present the question of whether to continue or to sunset the Innovation Interest Group at the [NDSA Digital Preservation 2016](/events) conference in Milwaukee in November, to all interested NDSA participants.  Attendees were asked their motivation for attending the interest group meeting, what they wished to accomplish, and if they thought the Innovation Interest Group, rather than some other interest or working group, was the best medium for accomplishing those interests.

The consensus was that the interests of participants were best served by other existing, or yet to be created, interest or working groups. It was decided officially to sunset the Innovation Interest Group. However, many new ideas were generated at the meeting and in prior group conversations, and we encourage participants to use the framework of the NDSA to explore them, creating new groups as needed.  (See [“Group Formation”](/working-groups) for more details.)

Wiki materials from past Innovation Innovation Group activities will be maintained as an historical record, and past publications and work products will remain available.
