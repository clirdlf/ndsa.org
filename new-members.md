NDSA organizations have proven themselves committed to long-term preservation of digital information. Our members include universities, consortia, commercial businesses, professional associations, and government agencies at the federal, state, and local level.

The NDSA is a voluntary membership organization with no dues or fees. Administrative support is provided by the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program at The Library of Congress.

The NDSA is about membership collaboration. Your organization’s participation is key. All NDSA work is collaborative. We look forward to your involvement and participation.

## Five Easy Ways to Get Involved
- Contact your working group co-chairs to learn more about how to get involved in a specific group or activity.
Offer to help take meeting minutes (this is always truly appreciated!).
Help with small or large tasks to accomplish working group goals.
Chat with your fellow members via the listserv - ask questions, tell us about your projects, introduce yourself!
Get your co-workers involved - if there are others in your organization that you'd like to get more involved, contact the NDSA Secretariat at ndsa@loc.gov or co-chairs to get them signed up.

I’m in the "wrong working group!"
Don't be afraid to change working groups. If the one you initially signed up for isn't a good fit, and you're more interested in activities going on in one of the other working groups, please feel free to change groups. We realize that as the work evolves, new members may find themselves in the "wrong" group. Contact a working group co-chair if you have questions about switching working groups.
