Welcome to the NDSA! Start by reviewing this website and the information to be found on the NDSA Wiki ([currently private](http://www.loc.gov/extranet/wiki/osi/ndiip/ndsa/index.php) at the Library of Congress; soon [public at the DLF](https://wiki.diglib.org/)). Then try... 

## Five Easy Ways to Get Involved
- Contact your [working group co-chairs](/working-groups/) to learn more about how to get involved in a specific group or activity.
- Offer to help take meeting minutes (this is always truly appreciated!).
- Help with small or large tasks to accomplish working group goals.
- Chat with your fellow members via the listserv - ask questions, tell us about your projects, introduce yourself!
- Encourage your co-workers to get involved.

## Have an idea for a project or activity?
- Email your idea to the working group listserv or the NDSA-ALL listserv.
- Contact your working group co-chairs.
Action teams may also be formed outside of (or within) the working groups to perform specific tasks or accomplish goals. Start one up!

## Need Help?
- Lost your wiki login or password? Go [here](http://www.loc.gov/extranet/wiki/osi/ndiip/ndsa/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Main_Page), and enter your log-in (the first part of your email address before the @). Click “Request a new password.” It will be sent to your email address.
- Listserv questions or problems?
If you or a colleague need to be added or removed from NDSA_ALL or one of the working group listservs, contact your working group co-chairs.
- I’m in the "wrong working group!"
Don't be afraid to change working groups. If the one you initially signed up for isn't a good fit, and you're more interested in activities going on in one of the other working groups, please feel free to change groups. We realize that as the work evolves, new members may find themselves in the "wrong" group. Contact a working group co-chair if you have questions about switching working groups.
- If all else fails, <ndsa@diglib.org>.
