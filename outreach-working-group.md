**The Outreach Interest Group is currently on hiatus.**

*Take me to the [Outreach Interest Group Listserv](http://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A0=NDSA-OUTREACH)! If you are already a member of this Interest Group, you can always access the listserv (including its archives) at that link. To join this Interest Group, please contact the coordinator.*

The Outreach Interest Group of the NDSA is focused on building relationships with stakeholder communities and preparing and sharing digital preservation information resources. These activities include: Identifying and assessing tools the NDSA community needs for communication; Identifying and promoting key digital preservation information resources; Defining opportunities for outreach within the NDSA and to the community beyond.

The scope of work of the Outreach Interest Group activities falls under three broad categories:

- Public Awareness
- Partner Recruitment
- Communication across the NDSA

These are instantiated through several specific campaigns and Action Teams. These include:

- [Digital Preservation in a Box](http://dpoutreach.net/)
- Organizational Outreach
- Preparing a Toolkit of Outreach Resources

You can join the conversation online at the [DLF Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/CLIRDLF/) or the [NDIIPP Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/digitalpreservation), and on Twitter with the hashtag [#NDSA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NDSA?src=hash) or through our [@NDSA2](https://twitter.com/#!/ndsa2) Twitter account.
