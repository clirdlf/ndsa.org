This glossary was developed by Library of Congress Junior Fellows and released in 2013 in support of NDSA's work on [Levels of Preservation](/activities/levels-of-digital-preservation/), as a means of providing a succinct definition of terms of special value to the NDSA and its extended digital stewardship community. Learn more about the development of the glossary [here](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2013/02/the-release-of-the-ndsa-digital-stewardship-glossary/).  

A set of [Working Definitions of Terms](https://osf.io/rynmf/) was created to support the [2019 Levels of Digital Preservation](/publications/levels-of-digital-preservation/).

    <td>A method to authenticate digital materials that consists of an encrypted digest of the file being signed. The digest is an algorithmically-computed numeric value based on the contents of the file. It is then encrypted with the private part of a public/private key pair. To prove that the file was not tampered with, the recipient uses the public key to decrypt the signature back into the original digest, recomputes a new digest from the transmitted file and compares the two to see if they match.
