### Digital Preservation Conference Navigator Program

The NDSA Conference Navigator program (loosely modeled on the DLF Forum mentoring program) is meant to be a lightweight, collegial networking opportunity for community members to connect and share expertise about navigating the annual Digital Preservation conference, being a part of the NDSA, as well as discussing relevant issues surrounding digital stewardship work in general. This program is focused around the annual Digital Preservation conference, with interested individuals electing to sign up during the registration process, communicating virtually in the lead-up to the event, and connecting again in person during the conference.
NDSA’s Digital Preservation Program Committee facilitates the matching based on expertise/interest areas, and navigator availability.
Conference navigators agree to:

- Exchange emails and/or set up at least one phone/video chat to get to know each other before the conference;
- Meet up as early as possible at Digital Preservation to be a friendly face, help make introductions, and generally advise on how to make the most of the conference;
- Offer career advice as requested, based on their own experience; and
- Maintain confidentiality and exhibit professionalism in all interactions (including by adhering to the DLF Code of Conduct).
 
Conference newcomers agree to:

- Be responsive and engaged when they receive contact from their navigator
- Take initiative if they don’t hear from their navigator, by reaching out directly to the mentor or to NDSA Program Committee staff; and
- Maintain confidentiality and exhibit professionalism in all interactions (including by adhering to the DLF Code of Conduct).
 
Although this program is anchored around the annual Digital Preservation conference, partners are encouraged to continue engagement if partners mutually agree to do so. NDSA is investigating potential future options for a more formalized, longer-form mentorship program.
If you missed the opportunity to join in past years or are eager to be involved again, be sure to sign up to become a navigator during the Digital Preservation registration process.
