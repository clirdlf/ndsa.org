### **About the NDSA and Digital Preservation 2020**

The NDSA is a consortium of [more than 250 organizations](https://ndsa.org/members-list/) committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. Digital Preservation 2020 ([#digipres20](https://twitter.com/hashtag/digipres20)) will be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of good practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field, helping to chart future directions for both the NDSA and digital stewardship.

### Covid-19 Updates
As an affiliated event of the DLF Forum, this Digital Preservation Conference will be transitioned to an online format.  This is based on the overwhelming responses to DLF's community survey, the number and distribution of proposals for all CFPs, and CLIR’s ongoing monitoring of the pandemic situation.  It is clear that for the health and safety of our attendees and presenters, we must transition all of our fall events to a virtual format. We are sorry we won’t be able to explore Baltimore in 2020, but we’re already making arrangements to hold our 2022 events there, so we’ll just have to wait a bit longer to enjoy time together in Charm City.

For more information and updates please review the DLF Forum's [Covid-19](https://forum2020.diglib.org/covid-19/) page.  Specific details to Digital Preservation 2020 will be posted on this website when available.  

<!-- The conference will be held at the beautiful [Renaissance Baltimore Harborplace Hotel](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bwish-renaissance-baltimore-harborplace-hotel/), on November 11-12, 2020, in Baltimore, Maryland.-->

The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event, and operates under the DLF Forum’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/code).
