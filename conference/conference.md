### About the NDSA and Digital Preservation 2021
The NDSA is a consortium of [{{ site.data.members.count }} organizations](/membership/members/) committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. Digital Preservation 2021 will be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of good practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field, helping to chart future directions for both the NDSA and digital stewardship.

The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event, and operates under the DLF Forumâ€™s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/code).
