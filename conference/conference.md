## Conference Navigator Program
Are you new to the NDSA? Is this your first time attending Digital Preservation? Or are you a veteran member who would like to help welcome someone new to the NDSA/DigiPres? If so, our Conference Navigator Program may be for you! 
The NDSA Conference Navigator Program is meant to be lightweight, collegial, and is focused around the annual Digital Preservation conference. It is a reconfiguration of the previous mentorship program focused specifically on the conference experience. The NDSA is looking at options for longer-term mentorship opportunities, that would not be limited to the annual conference.
NDSA facilitates the matching, based on expertise and new attendee requests. Navigators agree to:
- Exchange emails and/or set up a phone/video chat to get to know each other before the conference
- Meet up as early as possible at Digital Preservation (virtually), to be a friendly face, help make introductions, and generally advise on how to make the most of the conference
- Offer career advice as requested, based on their own experience
- Maintain confidentiality and exhibit professionalism in all interactions (including by adhering to the DLF’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/code).
