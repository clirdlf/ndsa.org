### About the NDSA and Digital Preservation 2022
The NDSA is a consortium of [{{ site.data.members.count }} organizations](/membership/members/) committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. It is an affiliate organization of CLIR and DLF. The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event, and operates under the DLF Forumâ€™s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/code).
