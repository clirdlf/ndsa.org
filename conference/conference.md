### **About the NDSA and Digital Preservation 2020**

The NDSA is a consortium of [more than 250 organizations](https://ndsa.org/members-list/) committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. Digital Preservation 2020 ([#digipres20](https://twitter.com/hashtag/digipres20)) will be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of good practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field, helping to chart future directions for both the NDSA and digital stewardship.

The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event, and operates under the DLF Forum’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/code).

Jennifer A. Ferretti (she/her) is an artist and Digital Initiatives Librarian at the Maryland Institute College of Art on Piscataway Land (Baltimore, Maryland). She is a first-generation American Latina/Mestiza whose librarianship is guided by critical perspectives, not neutrality. With a firm belief that art is information, she is interested in the research methodologies of artists and non-Western forms of knowledge making and sharing. Jennifer is a [Library Journal 2018 Mover and Shaker](https://www.libraryjournal.com/?detailStory=jennifer-a-ferretti-movers-shakers-2018-community-builders), and founder and principal of [We Here](https://www.wehere.space/),™️ a community dedicated to supporting folks who identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color in libraries and archives.
