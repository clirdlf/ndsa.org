### About the NDSA and Digital Preservation 2021
The NDSA is a consortium of [{{ site.data.members.count }} organizations](/membership/members/) committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. It is an affiliate organization of CLIR and DLF. The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event, and operates under the DLF Forum’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/code).

## Conference Navigator Program
Are you new to the NDSA? Is this your first time attending Digital Preservation? Or are you a veteran member who would like to help welcome someone new to the NDSA/DigiPres? If so, our Conference Navigator Program may be for you! 
The NDSA Conference Navigator Program is meant to be lightweight, collegial, and is focused around the annual Digital Preservation conference. It is a reconfiguration of the previous mentorship program focused specifically on the conference experience. The NDSA is looking at options for longer-term mentorship opportunities, that would not be limited to the annual conference.
NDSA facilitates the matching, based on expertise and new attendee requests. Navigators agree to:
- Exchange emails and/or set up a phone/video chat to get to know each other before the conference
- Meet up as early as possible at Digital Preservation (virtually), to be a friendly face, help make introductions, and generally advise on how to make the most of the conference
- Offer career advice as requested, based on their own experience
- Maintain confidentiality and exhibit professionalism in all interactions (including by adhering to the DLF’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/code).
