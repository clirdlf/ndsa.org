### **2-D Virtual Lounge**
 
 Feeling that Zoom fatigue but interested in trying a new way to connect? Join fellow DigiPres attendees for an experimental, virtual gathering in a beta spatialized audio environment (think avatars exploring a 2-D space and having conversations with one another) from [High Fidelity](https://www.highfidelity.com/). Space is limited and requires advance registration. This gathering will take place between 12:30-1:00 PM EST/9:30-10:00 AM PST.
 
 **How to participate:**
 - Before registering, all participants must carefully [review the DLF Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/about/code-of-conduct/) and agree to abide by the Code of Conduct. Those who violate the Code of Conduct may be warned or expelled at the discretion of the organizers.
 - In order to get the full experience, participants should have microphone and speaker capabilities; no video necessary.
 - All participants must use their real names, which will be designated upon entering the room.
 - Moderators will be stationed in the middle of the virtual space, on the DigiPres conference logo. Moderators will be identifiable by NDSA logo avatars.
 - Please keep in mind this is a beta test environment, and feedback for the developers is welcome.
 - Do not use a VPN to connect.
 
 [You can register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ndsa-digipres-2-d-virtual-lounge-tickets-126585429427). The day of the conference, registrants will be sent a link to access the virtual room via email. Please do not share your link with others.
 
### **CLIR Events Photo Booth**
 
 In partnership with Baltimore-based small business [Pixilated](https://www.pixilated.com/), CLIR will be offering a photo booth for attendees this year! PixiWeb is a virtual photo booth experience that helps keep everyone connected through shared event photo galleries and experiences…all accessible from a single link! The photo booth will be available to attendees of all three of this year’s events. Details may be found [here](https://forum2020.diglib.org/social-wellness-activities/).
 
### **Asynchronous Virtual Tours and Wellness Resources**
 Since we couldn’t welcome you to Baltimore in-person this year, the DLF Forum Community Committee and DigiPres volunteers put together some [virtual tours, exhibitions, activities, and wellness resources from some of our favorite Baltimore-based organizations and museums](https://forum2020.diglib.org/social-wellness-activities/wellness-resources/).
