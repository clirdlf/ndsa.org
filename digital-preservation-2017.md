<img alt="meetings" width="480" height="270" src='{{ "/images/NDSA-DigitalPreservation-SiteBanner.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}'>

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) will hold its annual conference, [_**Digital Preservation 2017: “Preservation is Political,”**_](https://forum2017.diglib.org/ndsas-digital-preservation/) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, **October 25-26, 2017**.

Digital Preservation is the major meeting and conference of the NDSA—open to members and non-members alike—focusing on tools, techniques, theories and methodologies for digital stewardship and preservation, data curation, the content lifecycle, and related issues. Our 2017 meeting is once again held in partnership with our host organization, the Digital Library Federation (DLF). DLF's October 22nd [pre-conference](https://www.diglib.org/dlf-events/past//2017forum/dlflac/) event (bringing together HBCUs and liberal arts colleges) and the [2017 DLF Forum](https://www.diglib.org/dlf-events/past//2017forum/) (23-24 October) are all happening in the same location.


### About the NDSA and Digital Preservation 2017

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance is a consortium of [more than 210 organizations](http://ndsa.org/members-list/) committed to the long-term preservation and stewardship of digital information and cultural heritage, for the benefit of present and future generations. _Digital Preservation 2017_ ([#digipres17](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digipres17&src=typd)) will help to chart future directions for both the NDSA and digital stewardship, and is expected to be a crucial venue for intellectual exchange, community-building, development of best practices, and national-level agenda-setting in the field.

The conference will be held at the [Westin Convention Center](http://www.westinpittsburgh.com/) “where downtown buzz meets restorative sleep”, just blocks from historic [Market Square](http://marketsquarepgh.com/), [The Andy Warhol Museum](http://www.warhol.org/), boutiques, restaurants, and nightlife. The NDSA strives to create a safe, accessible, welcoming, and inclusive event, and will operate under the DLF Forum’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/about/code-of-conduct/).

### Keynote Speaker: Eira Tansey

Eira Tansey will open _Digital Preservation 2017_  with a talk (title TBD) that will explore the relationship between **environmental policy** and the **preservation of records**, and **what implications this has for the future of climate justice**.

Tansey is the Digital Archivist/Records Manager at the University of Cincinnati, where she is responsible for institutional records management, developing digital preservation policies, and working with born-digital archives. She previously worked at Tulane University Library’s Louisiana Research Collection, and has a B.A. in Geography from the University of Cincinnati, and an M.L.I.S. from San Jose State University’s School of Information.

Tansey’s research and writing focuses on the intersection of archives, the environment, and climate change. Her 2015 article “[Archival adaptation to climate change](http://sspp.proquest.com/archival-adaptation-to-climate-change-3f245c06d9c0)” called for a broad response from the American archivist community to consider the impact of climate change on the profession and documentary cultural heritage. Her current work focuses on the relationship between records, land ownership, and environmental policy. She is also working with colleagues from Penn State University to map American archives’ exposure to climate change, and is collaborating on a [Society of American Archivists Foundation grant](http://www2.archivists.org/news/2017/saa-foundation-awards-two-strategic-growth-grants) to develop a comprehensive open  database of archival repository location data to aid future spatial analysis.

She currently serves as the vice-chair of the Society of American Archivists Records Management Section, as co-chair of the Midwest Archives Conference 2018 meeting program committee, and is resident caretaker for ProjectARCC (Archivists Responding to Climate Change). Tansey is a member of the 2017 Archives Leadership Institute cohort.
