<p>NDSA members commit to having participants in one or more Working Groups. Working Groups identify tasks and develop work plans that will be accomplished by participants.</p>

<p>Each Working Group is led by a pair of co-chairs that commit to promoting the tasks of the working group that have been identified by participants. One co-chair is from a member organization, the second co-chair is a representative from the Library of Congress.</p>

<p>Questions about what working group you should join? Send an email to ndsa@loc.gov.</p>
