## Membership Information
NDSA member organizations are committed to long-term digital stewardship. Individuals from member organizations share expertise, tools, and practices to benefit local efforts while contributing to the stewardship of a growing collective collection of diverse digital content. Our members collaborate in many ways that benefit the digital preservation community and their organizations. NDSA depends on members contributing their efforts in a variety of ways such as participation in our Interest and Working Groups, in order to develop, expand, and share their knowledge and expertise. Learn more [about the NDSA](/about/).

There are no fees or dues for membership in the NDSA, but members are expected to be engaged and contribute to and participate in NDSA initiatives.
