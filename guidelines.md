## NDSA Community Guidelines

We need everyoneâ€™s help to keep NDSA a friendly and creative community where people with different backgrounds and interests feel welcome.

- **Be open.** We invite anyone to participate in our community. We preferably use public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive.
- **Be respectful and kind.** We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in a welcoming, friendly, empathetic, patient, and respectful fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. We are respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people outside our community.
- **Be collaborative.** NDSA was conceived and executed as a collaborative effort from its very beginning. Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of an initiative, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.
- **Share.**  NDSA is committed to openness and transparency in all that it does including initiatives, publications and discussions. All NDSA content will be shared with the community under an open license.  
- **Help keep the community friendly.** When you see people acting outside of these guidelines, let them know, and refer them here. If the behavior is repeated, or if If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a local meeting organizer, the NDSA community helpers (email), a community member you trust, or the NDSA Coordination Committee immediately.

NDSA welcomes people of all races, colors, sex, religions, national origins, ages, sexual orientations, disabilities, gender identities and expressions, marital statuses, genetic predispositions and carrier status, military status, and beyond.

## Code of Conduct & Anti-Harassment Policy

NDSA is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience for everyone. NDSA has established the following policy & protocol to make it clear that we do not tolerate harassment in any form. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, or any community channel such as IRC-based chat rooms or mailing lists.


Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to sex, gender, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, religion; sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks, online discussions, or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.


Participants in NDSA communication channels violating the anti-harassment policy may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the organizers of the meeting (if the channel is an in-person event) or the NDSA Coordinating Committee (if the channel is online). If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact meeting organizers or members of the NDSA Coordinating Committee immediately.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers and Coordinating Committee representatives (or their designees) may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the meeting or other community channels, or contacting a higher authority such as a representative from the offender's institution.

We expect participants to follow the anti-harassment policy at all meeting venues, meeting-related social events, community gatherings, and online communication channel.
