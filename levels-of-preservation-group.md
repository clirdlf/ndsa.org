# The Levels Reboot
## Project Plan
From the members of the [Levels Reboot Team](#levels-reboot-team).

### Project overview and description

### Overview

The NDSA launched its Levels of Preservation (LoP) guidelines in 2013 as a tiered set of recommendations on how organizations should begin to build or enhance their digital preservation activities. They function as the key tool to help practitioners of all levels deploy a sustainable digital preservation strategy. Since that time practitioners across the globe have been working with the guidelines and some have been extending and adapting them.

The original intent of the LoP was to create tiered set of recommendations for either preservation practitioners who were just starting out or for those looking to deepen their preservation strategy. Not meant as a comprehensive preservation strategy but rather a lightweight tool to encourage organizations to think through preservation issues.  The LoP are organized into five functional areas that are at the heart of digital preservation systems: storage and geographic location, file fixity and data integrity, information security, metadata, and file formats. By design, they do not cover policy or staffing considerations. They are considered to be a technical implementation of a variety of preservation decisions and are utilized by many organizations across the country and even internationally.

With the current rapid changes in technology, a document that functions as the technical implementation of a preservation strategy, needs updating after 5 years.  In addition, after 5 years of active use, users have expressed the need to add features and considerations.

### Description

This project will engage key stakeholders and other communities to:

- Create an updated version of the Levels document;
- Create other materials to support an updated Levels document, such as case studies and teaching materials; and,
- Articulate an ongoing strategy by which the Levels can be adapted and updated on a regular basis.

## Project managers and key stakeholders

The members of the Levels Reboot Team, a subgroup of the NDSA Coordinating Committee, share project management responsibilities, and shall be responsible to NDSA members through the NDSA Coordinating Committee.

All project details and the activities will be overseen by the [Levels Reboot Team](#levels-reboot-team).

The NDSA initially launched its [Levels of Digital Preservation](http://ndsa.org/activities/levels-of-digital-preservation/) guidelines in 2013. The Levels’ authors wrote about the philosophy behind the publication [here](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/documents/NDSA_Levels_Archiving_2013.pdf). Since that time practitioners across the globe have been working with the guidelines and some have been extending and adapting them. Response to and adoption of the Levels has far exceeded NDSA’s expectations.

This new Working Group’s primary task will be to provide the methodology by which the important NDSA Levels of Preservation document can be adapted more readily—taking in the broadest possible feedback in the process. We will not limit the group to NDSA members, though we will strongly encourage everyone interested in this project to consider [joining the National Digital Stewardship Alliance](http://ndsa.org/get-involved/). The preliminary charge for this group will be to:

- Identify those actively engaged in adapting the Levels
- Cast a wide net for those willing to engage in updating the current version
- Create a methodology by which disparate approaches can be fully vetted and harmonized into a Version 2.0 of the Levels
- Devise an ongoing strategy by which the Levels can be adapted on a regular basis.

A call for interest and participation was sent out in April 2018 and the community’s response has been tremendous. Practitioners from all over the globe have responded that they are either using the NDSA’s Levels guidelines or would like to assist in the creation of Version 2.0. We hope to harness the excellent work that is already underway and create a series of international groups to help refine and test the new proposed changes.

## Principle audiences
### Key stakeholders
- NDSA Coordinating Committee
- Digital Library Federation (DLF) and subgroups (e.g. Born-Digital Access Group)
- Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR)
- NDSA Interest Groups (Infrastructure, Content, Standards and Practices)
- NDSA Working Groups (especially National Agenda, Fixity, and Conference Planning)
- Other NDSA-led groups (e.g. Preservation Storage Group, Cloud Studies Subgroup)

### Communities whose input or support is needed
- [NDSA member organizations](http://ndsa.org/members-list/)
- Digital preservation service providers
- Allied national and international organizations
- The global digital preservation practitioners’ community

## Community consultation and communications
Consultation and communication with NDSA members and the broader digital preservation community is especially critical in the early stages of this project.

The Levels Reboot Team will report to NDSA Coordinating Committee on a regular basis and provide project updates via regularly scheduled Zoom meetings. The Levels Reboot Team will also ensure that Working Groups convene on a regular basis and report out on progress. All documentation related to these meetings, as well as related documents, will be made accessible for review and approval as appropriate. The Levels Reboot Team will also provide written updates and other documentation to the NDSA Coordinating Committee ahead of all Annual General Meetings, in a timely manner as directed by the NDSA Coordinating Committee Chair, and will also make themselves available for presentations and discussions as required.
